Not wanting to take any chances we decided to switch to a cruise at the last minute and book a different resort.  This resulted in us booking at the Cofresi Palms in Puerto Plata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, coming on the heels of two very long vacations I needed to make this something of a working vacation to make sure the materials for the AC201 course were as good as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of mornings I worked in our room, which was a really nice two bedroom suite with wonderful views of the beach.  But then we discovered these covered beds right on the beach, big enough for all of us to hang out together and in the shade, with good enough WiFi for everything except video conferencing.  So I switched — can you blame me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My office" src="/images/beach_office.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling with our friends Brian and Holly is always super relaxing.  Whether its hanging at the pool bar or playing cards at the beach we always have a great time.  We planned absolutely no activities for this week so it was really all about reading, and lounging, which made it easy for me to mix in some work too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our first ever experience at an all inclusive resort, so we had very little in the way of expectations.  And mostly they were met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things were a nice surprise.  Our room, a “penthouse suite” was very nice.  We had a living and kitchen area on the first floor with a fridge full of water, soda and beer.  We also really liked the coffee pot in the room.  The bedrooms upstairs were huge, each with its own deck and spectacular view of the resort and ocean.  Our bathroom was fine, but in serious need of updating and new grout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican and the Indian restaurant.  We should have eaten all our meals at these two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had read about the “men in the hats” before we arrived.  A small army of high pressure sales people that will try anything to get you into a sales pitch situation, and invest in the timeshare.  “Tours”, better breakfasts, free golf cart rides, tokens for upgrades your next time back... They really try to get you the first day, and then came at us again hard towards the end.  Dodging them became a kind of sport for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bands.  Everyone has to wear a wristband.  These identify you and your level.  Lots of places are for VIPs only, so if you don’t have the right colored band you are not welcome.  We were not VIPs.  See the previous paragraph for another part of their sales tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cups.  All of our drinks came in these tiny plastic cups.  Brian referred to the beers that came in them as “beer shots”. There was one kind of beer - El Presidenté, All of the drinks were watered down, but hey what they lack in quality they made up for in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service.  I feel bad writing such negative stuff, but the staff at the restaurants was really apathetic.  Sometimes we were so rushed that we could hardly enjoy our food.  Other times the service was so slow that we mostly had lost interest by the time it was served.  We did learn that a $1 tip could get you a lot of good will and even a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell.  Running through the middle of the resort is a cement canal with a big sewage pipe suspended in the canal.  The pipe leaked.  The smell permeated everything downwind, which included one of the largest pool areas in the complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But we still had fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve listed a lot of negatives, and that may be because I’m a snob.  But in the end we still had a lot of fun, and spent some great time reading and relaxing.  I would do an all inclusive again sometime, maybe, but it won’t be this one, and I think I have a lot of other places and things on my list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome Back to Minneapolis</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/welcome-back-snow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-02-04:/PelicanBlog/welcome-back-snow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An overnight flight from Quito, very little sleep, 90 degree temperature drop, and ❄️ ❄️ ❄️&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well it was bound to happen, and as we like to say, it could have been worse.  Landed at MSP just before 9:00 this morning.  It was 1 degree Fahrenheit (-17 C) and the snow was just starting to Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Galapagos cruise was unlike any other we have been on. High on the active scale, high on the learning new things every day scale, and with the small ship very high on the meet interesting people scale.  As the hotel manager John Flynn told us, they are very well aware that this cruise is a bucket list trip for most passengers, and they really do their best to make it memorable.  And that was just one component of this trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Rainforest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machu Picchu and Inca trail hike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cusco and the Sacred Valley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Galápagos Islands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane and I have had so many interesting experiences on this trip that it seems like we have been gone for months, not just the three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Quito early this morning (12:30AM) and arrived in Atlanta by 5:30.  Getting through customs and making the transfer to the domestic gates was a breeze thanks to our Global Entry passes.  But neither of us ended up sleeping on that flight and we just dozed a little on the flight to Minneapolis, so we were both beat by the time we got out of the Uber in downtown Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to wake up a bit, I went down to use the elliptical in our workout room.  As the minutes ticked away I watched the Wells Fargo building and IDS Tower disappear into the increasingly heavy snowfall.  We are supposed to get more than four inches today, and you can see that even this afternoon it is still coming down pretty heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Minneapolis/welcome_back_snow.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all good trips, we learned a lot, came to appreciate new cultures, old histories, and new parts of the globe.  It’s great to get away and get a new perspective on the business of everyday life, and to evaluate one’s priorities.  But as the saying goes, there is no place like home.  We are happy to be back, and already looking forward to an exciting weekend of activities including a play at the Guthrie and a broadway series performance!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Galapagos"></category></entry><entry><title>Darwin Research Center</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/darwin-research.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-02T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-02-02:/PelicanBlog/darwin-research.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an all day adventure, including Darwin Research station, helping to reforest, and Giant Tortoises&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We started our day today with a visit to the Darwin Research Center.  One of the main projects at this center is the preservation of the many different species of tortoises on the islands.  Many of which were hunted to near extinction by whalers or pushed out of their habitat by goats, dogs and cats.  The tortoise in the image below is a saddle back!  A close genetic relative of “Lonesome George” that last true Saddleback that died a few years back.  You can see that they have very long necks which is an adaptation for eating the cacti on the desert islands of the Galapagos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/saddleback.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course we saw many of the Galapagos Tortoise both at the Darwin center and later on in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/teen_tortoise.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/galapagos_tortoise.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another highlight of the day was our chance to participate in Celebrity Cruise Lines reforestation project.  Many of the native Escalesa trees were choked out by the blackberries that were imported by the settlers on the islands.  With a lot of work the blackberries have been culled, but now Celebrity is working to replant many many acres of forrest with native Escalesa trees.  To date Celebrity and their guests have planted nearly 40,000 trees, and I’m happy that we got to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/planting_escalesas.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus we all got to wear the super stylish rubber boots!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Galapagos"></category></entry><entry><title>I 💙 Boobies</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/boobies.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-02-01:/PelicanBlog/boobies.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A hike on San Cristobal island allows us to see Red Footed Boobies, Blue Footed Boobies and the Nasca Boobies.  I couldn’t resist the title!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By this time of the trip the routine was well established.  Breakfast in the morning, then off to the zodiacs for an adventure / hike on shore.  Back to the ship for lunch and a rest during the worst heat of the day, then a late afternoon zodiac to another destination for another hike.  This is definitely an adventure not a vacation!  This afternoons hike was billed as the most difficult of the trip, because it involved a little rock scrabbling!  As usual a few people joined that really shouldn’t have, you would think people would learn their limitations by this time.  Anyway, after the rock scrabbling we were rewarded with a beautiful view of the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/island_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we saw a lot of Blue Footed Boobies, we had to leave the trail to keep our distance from them several times as they just sit in the middle of the path looking at us.  It was definitely worthwhile as this is probably one of my favorite photos of this whole adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/blue_with_eggs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue footed boobies take turns on the nest, if you can call it that.  It’s barely even a hole in the ground.  Further, they don’t really even sit on the eggs, they kind of cradle them with their feet.  Here’s a picture of the “changing of the guard”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/changing_the_guard.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reds are not nearly as interesting as the blues.  They are arboreal and so you rarely see them on the ground.  Their feet are red, but not bright red like the bright blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/red_boobies.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the beach where we landed to start the hike was a small colony of sea lions.&lt;/p&gt;

The main objective was to see the Land Iguanas.  These creatures have been restored to the island after they were endangered by feral dogs and goats that humans brought to the island.  Santa Cruz is one of the few islands that is actually inhabited.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover picture for this post is actually of a marine iguana that was near the shore by a brackish pool.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="green marine" src="/images/Galapagos/green_marine.jpg"&gt;
You can see a very clear difference in coloration and shape between the marine variety — which can swim using their tails for propulsion — and the land iguanas pictured below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point they moved many of the Land Iguanas to an alternative island without any human habitation for them to come back, while they started a program to eradicate all of the goats and feral dogs.  We actually saw a goat along the way, and the guides, who are also park rangers when they are on land, had to call it in so that the goat could be tracked down and captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/wild_goat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the walk started at 8:00 and already it was really hot.  We began the walk on the beach and quickly passed by this beautiful brackish water pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/brackish_reflections.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path was very muddy from rain the previous night, and a few people from the group ahead of us called it quits and headed back to the beach.  But we kept going, eyes peeled for our first siteing.  The first Land Iguana we met was pretty hard to miss as he was right on the trail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/lizard_in_path.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we spotted the first one we started to see quite a few of them.  Some close to the path, some sitting right outside their burrows, some “lounge lizards” hanging out on a log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/iguana2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/land_iguana.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/lounge_lizard.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery on the island was also very beautiful and couldn’t have been more different than our hike up the volcano from the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/green_island.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon Snorkel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we had a beach snorkeling stop.  The water was pretty wavy and as a result the visibility was not very good.  I was right next to a big sea turtle and I could easily have grabbed onto the shell to go for a ride.  But you don’t touch the wild animals so I just followed it and admired it s grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real highlight of the snorkeling trip was the Pelicans.  After coming back to shore there were about 3 brown pelicans that decided it was feeding time.  They are “shallow plungers” so they swoop up into the air about 15 to 20 feet and then plunge awkwardly into the water to capture a fish!  They were definitely not deterred by all of the humans in the water as several swooped right next to people!  The pelicans were fine, but the people were a bit shocked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/pinnacle_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will likely see even better photos than the one above as we were there at the wrong time of day for optimal photo lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike was mostly just climbing the 366 old wooden stairs and many boardwalks to the top of the volcano where there is a great viewing and picture taking spot.  Along the way we stopped to learn a bit about volcanology, spatter cones, calderas, and craters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naturalists on board are all great and really knowledgeable.  Most, if not all, of them were born on the islands and you can tell they all really love it.&lt;/p&gt;

Had our luck changed?  Were we going to have a rainy day after all?  I went up on deck to investigate and was happy to see that it was just a dense fog.  Caused by the cold water currents running up against the Galapagos ridge.  It would burn off.  All credit to Ann who insisted that we take the 10:00 excursion rather than the 8:00 excursion.  This is what the fog looked like just before we boarded our zodiac at 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/morning_fog.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later learned that it was so foggy during the 8:00 trip that one of the zodiacs took a wrong turn in all of the mangrove and got lost for a bit.  Apparently everyone was taking it in stride and singing the theme song to Gillian’s island (except for one passenger who was not amused). I almost wish I was on that boat so I could tell the story in more detail.  Here you can just barely make out our ship in the fog from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/foggy_expedition.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were headed into a huge lagoon protected by mangroves but on the way we got some good sitings of a few of the marine birds.  Below is the famous Blue Footed Boobie.  Yes, I kind of giggle inside like a seventh grader every time I say that.  The reality is that the name comes from the fact that they act like clowns during their mating dance.  Kicking their legs up and flapping their wings and acting like fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/blue_footed_boobie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got very close to a few brown pelicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/flying_pelican.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we saw the Galapagos Penguin!  The second smallest penguin in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/sitting_penguin.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They look kind of dopey and slow when they are out of the water but when they are in the water they swim fast and graceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/swimming_penguin.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw turtles all over the place poking their heads out of the water, but it was not until the afternoon when we did our deep water snorkel that we really got to have a great view of the turtles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/turtle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the trip we were way back amongst the mangroves and we saw a sea lion sleeping on a branch just a few feet above the water.  We also had a very close encounter with a Great Blue Heron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/blue_heron.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also lucky enough to see some golden rays swimming just beneath us. Too bad that we were not able to capture them on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hike at Tagus Bay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was in Tagus bay where we started with a drift snorkel. It was great, we saw a lot of sea turtles, and fish, but the most amazing was when I got to watch one of the penguins swimming underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we dried off from the snorkel trip we headed out for the “fitness hike” This was billed as a faster paced walk with fewer stops but the same great scenery.  With people of all different ages on the cruise the walks tend to go at the pace of the slowest person in the group so we thought this would be a good option.  And it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/tagus_bay.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed 150 stairs and then walked a bit to have a great view of the bay and this highly salty inland lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a mile we came to the end of the trail where we could see the difference between the two sides of the volcano we were climbing.  We were climbing the wet side and were suddenly treated to a huge vista of the dry side.  You could images that you had just landed on mars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/hike_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took another short zodiac ride to view the geology of the volcano and some of the wildlife.  Here you can see the layers where the older layers have oxidized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/volcanic_layers.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got back on the ship we had time to relax with a happy hour drink and enjoy the amazing sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/tagus_sunset.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next was a delicious dinner where we watched one of our exhausted fellow passengers fall asleep right at her table with conversation and laughter going on all around her.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner there was a small party to celebrate crossing the equator on our way around the north end of Isabella island.  We were all encouraged to do the limbo and imitate one of our favorite Galapagos animals.  As a group we did the blue footed boobie dance, and narrowly lost the contest to a couple imitating sea lions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Galapagos"></category></entry><entry><title>Galápagos Islands!!</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/Gal%C3%A1pagos-day1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-01-27:/PelicanBlog/Galápagos-day1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our first day in the Galápagos Islands is everything we ever thought it would be and more!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Iguanas fighting over territory, thousands of crabs, two species of sea lions, lizards galore, birds and even a snake; this is what we saw on our first day in the Galápagos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a good practice day as we all learned about “wet landings” and “dry landings” in the Zodiacs we use to transfer from the ship to the shore.  We go in groups of up to sixteen people along with a naturalist that will take us on our hike once on shore.  It’s a bit of a process this first day to get off the zodiac in the water, then change shoes in the hot sand, but we are getting the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hiked for about 90 minutes and saw a lot of amazing animals...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="baby sealion" src="/images/Galapagos/baby_sealion.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first came ashore, we saw this baby sea lion just hanging out on the rock.  Very cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lizard" src="/images/Galapagos/lizard.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing we noticed was the lizards.  They were everywhere and you had to be careful as you were walking so that you didn’t step on them!  They are cold blooded so at this time of the morning they were all out on the warm sand bringing up their body temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="birds" src="/images/Galapagos/fly_catcher.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the Galapagos are home to many many birds, and they have no fear of humans, very few of the animals on the islands do!  But this one takes the cake as it landed on Ann’s hat.  The guide told us that they really like cameras with big lenses and that they will use them like a mirror to admire themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/resting_sealions.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hiking the inland part of the trail we started to walk the shoreline.  Our first site was the sealions.  They are nocturnal, so they were just floating in the cool waters and resting during the day.  Looks like a pretty good life to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/iguana_crabs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shoreline was just full of these red crabs, called “sally light foot crabs”.  Here you can also see one of the many iguanas looking at them. The iguanas eat algae so its not hunting them.  The Oyster catcher birds, do hunt the crabs, and we saw some of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/marine_iguana.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the king of the iguanas!  Looks like he is in charge to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rabida Island&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/rabida_island.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we headed to Rabida island for some more hiking and snorkeling.  Here we are in all of our orange splendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/ann_jane.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/brad_jerry.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike was hot but really beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/prickly_pear.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just loved how the prickly pear cacti just grow right out of the lava rock on this island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/brackish_lake.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a brackish lake.  Much of the water comes from rain and runoff from the hill behind, but at high tide, some water can flow over the mangrove berm and into the lake as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Galapagos/frigate.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the frigate bird.  They are amazing in that they steal food from other birds right out of the air!  They also love to float and glide alongside and above the ship as we slowly reposition ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Galapagos"></category></entry><entry><title>At the Equator</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/at-the-equator.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-01-25:/PelicanBlog/at-the-equator.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The highlight of our day of touring in Quito was definitely our stop at the Equator.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Ecuador is a great place to study the equator.  It’s not in the middle of a jungle, but runs close to Quito with lots of varying terrain.  They thought that they had the equator nailed, but then along came GPS and they found out there were off by about 200 meters.  Now at the new and improved site we got to explore some of the common, cool things you hear about our hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did the water test.  Yes, when the sink is directly on the equator the water goes straight down the drain.  Moving it ten feet to the south the water makes a vortex going clockwise.  When you move the sink 10 feet to the north the water drains counterclockwise!  This is supposed to demonstrate the Coriolis effect, but I’m skeptical (and so are lots of other folks) that the effect would really be that different just a few feet either side of the equator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We balanced an egg on the head of a nail.  It was a bit windy and tricky to get right, but in the end both Jane and I accomplished the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw the sundial telling us the “true time”. It was about 20 minutes off from my watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we did a strength test.  This seems to be the most controversial and unexplained of all of the equator tests we did.  Standing a few feet off the equator you can resist quite well someone pulling down on your arms.  But standing directly on the equator line you seem to lose all your strength.  Other than psychological explanations for this I haven’t found a physics based reason for why this is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the moment it doesn’t matter whether any of these things are true or not, it was a good and fun way to spend our afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Ecuador"></category></entry><entry><title>Cusco Cooking!</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/cusco-cooking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-01-24:/PelicanBlog/cusco-cooking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A morning Cooking Class with Jose at Peru Culinary Adventures is great fun!  In the afternoon we visit the famous SaqsayWaman !&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a morning with Chef Jose you will definitely believe that Peru is the center of the culinary universe, and has been for thousands of years.  Did you know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/chef_jose.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All tomatoes in the world originated in Peru?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All potatoes in the world originated in Peru?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peru has been the top culinary destination in the world for several years running?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are thousands of varieties of potatoes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are at least 3 different varieties of passion fruit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef Jose picked us up at our hotel, and walked us the few blocks to his restaurant/culinary school.  We started out with a fruit quiz.  We actually got the first 4 of nine correct.  Jose said we did way better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the quiz we tasted each of the fruits.  Yes, me, I tasted all of them.  Truthfully I liked most of them, except the one that looked and had the same texture as an avocado!  The quiz didn’t include any banana or plantain as I had already told the chef I couldn’t eat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/fruit_test.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, every few minutes someone would come in with a new appetizer for us to taste.  Crunchy bruschetta and shrimp with Peruvian cheese melted on top. Delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fruit tasting we went into the next room where we were introduced to many different ingredients used in Peruvian cooking.  We learned about many different types of Quinoa, which has become so popular around the world that Peruvians have had to look for alternatives because its become so expensive in Peru!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was a bit of mixology.  We learned how to make the traditional Pisco Sour and another drink called a Chilcano.  It was too sweet for both of us, so we decided to stick with the Pisco Sour.  Which we took with us into the kitchen where we started on our first dish of the day.  Ceviche — “Made with Love”. We learned not to trust any ceviche that is made and allowed to sit more than a few minutes before serving.  Of course this means you need to make certain that your fish is absolutely fresh and perfect before you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ceviche was served with crunchy corn kernels and small cubes of sweet potato.  Peruvian chefs love to play with combinations of flavors and textures and this combination definitely allowed for that!  It was great, sweet potatoes are even tolerable if you have enough ceviche sauce on them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/ceviche.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enjoying our ceviche and a little of our Pisco Sour we moved on to our second dish.  A classic in Peru, called Lomo Saltado.  It combines the wok cooking that influenced Peruvian chefs years ago with crunchy French fries and the rice that is so prevalent in Peruvian cooking.  Like many Asian dishes this one cooks very quickly in a very hot wok once you get everything prepped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/wok_fire.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finished the dish we took it outside and ate it all under an umbrella along with our Pisco Sour drinks.  It was great and definitely something I’ll try to replicate back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great culinary experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Cusco and looking to learn a bit more about Peruvian history and culture through the food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/outdoor_lunch.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saqsay Waman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/saqsay_sign.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, if you say the above title out loud a few times you will know that I had to include that in this post. — Not getting it?  Then think Sexy Woman.  No, its not a risqué statue in the middle of Cusco it is another huge Incan structure on one of the many hills surrounding Cusco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/saqsaywaman.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk around the Saqsay Waman site was also our first chance to get up close to a Llama (pronounced Yama by the locals)&lt;/p&gt;

But, by the time Fernando picked us up to go to the bus, the sun was shining and it looked like we were going to have great weather for our visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate I wasn’t sure what was left.  Plenty, as it turns out.  It was just amazing to walk with our guide through this huge complex and marvel at the design and engineering.  For everything you see above ground there is also underground engineering work to create the drainage system that has kept Machu Picchu stable all of these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/machu_picchu_in1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest threats to Machu Picchu is the number of humans that visit each year.  It wasn’t designed to handle that kind of traffic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/machu_picchu_in2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machu Picchu was never finished, due to the Spanish invasion, but nevertheless many people lived there over the five generations it took to get it to what we see.  During that time there was even much rebuilding as priests died and new priests took their place and wanted to change or move the various temples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see several different levels of workmanship.  From the super high quality at some of the lower layers and in the places where the important people lived to the lesser quality near the top as they rushed to finish, or simply didn’t care to do the same quality of workmanship for the new Spanish conquerors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a morning of wandering around, we had a delicious lunch at the restaurant right in the national park.  Then headed down to Agua Caliente where it started to pour rain again.  We hung out in the market for a while then headed to the hotel, where we met up with Bob and Bonni and sat by the fire until it was time to board our train to take us back to Cusco.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Peru"></category></entry><entry><title>You never know who you will meet on the Inca Trail</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-Inca-trail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-01-22:/PelicanBlog/the-Inca-trail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A seven hour hike on the Inca trail brings some surprise meetings!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I woke up around 3:30AM when I heard a few splatters of rain against the roof of our Casita.  The alarm was set to go off at 5AM, groaning internally I rolled over and listened to the rain turn from splatters to a steady stream.  Our goal for the day was to do the 7.5 mile Inca Trail hike to the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu.  I really was not looking forward to doing that in the rain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much tossing and turning 5:00 finally came and we headed up for an early breakfast.  We were meeting our guide and driver at 6:00 to head to the train for the trip to our drop off point.  At breakfast we met Bob and Bonni who were taking the same train, but going all the way to Agua Caliente and visiting Machu Picchu from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the lobby to meet our guide, Bonni was on the phone with their guide.  It seems that there was a big accident on the way from Cusco and that their driver was going to be at last 30 minutes late, which would cause them to miss the train.  We volunteered to ask our guide to see if they could ride with us rather than riding in the taxi and everything worked out great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About halfway to the drop off point the rain stopped!  By the time we were ready to hit the trail we could actually see a few patches of blue sky peeking through the clouds.  This was looking like a good day for hiking after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/trail_brad.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one day hike has three main parts.  The first half is up hill where we gained over 1500 feet of elevation.  The next section is billed as being pretty flat, but that’s a lie.  It’s flat until the end where you have to climb up to the Sun gate.  From the Sun gate its all downhill, but that is maybe the last 1/8 of the 7.5 mile hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took it at a good pace and enjoyed most of the climb.  The scenery got better and better as we climbed higher.  We were mostly alone on the trail.  There was another pair of hikers that started just a bit before we did, and every so often we could catch sight of a larger group of 9 ahead of us on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon we were high enough to look down on the trains as they passed with passengers heading to Agua Caliente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/agua_caliente_trail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sites we got to see along our hike was the amazing Wiñay Wayra terraces.  It was beautiful to see from the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/winaywayra.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought it looked close, but somehow we kept walking and it never seemed to get any closer.  Finally we came down a few stairs then up a few stairs and stopped for a rest at the base of a waterfall. This was our time to gather our energy for the climb through Wiñay Wayra.  When we arrived the group of nine was just leaving, so we felt like we were doing a good job of keeping the pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/brad_jane_waterfall.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks a lot more daunting in person than it does in this photo.  And when we finally got to the base I started counting stairs. We were able to do about 60 at a time then we would have to stop and rest and catch our breath.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/big_climb.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The altitude definitely makes it harder work!  After 375 stairs we finally arrived at the terrace about 2/3 of the way up where we were able to go across and exit.  This was an amazing place for a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/brad_jane_terraces.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was basically the end of the uphill part.  Both of us were extremely happy about that.  The next couple of hours were pretty easy and we made good time.  At some point along the way we even passed the larger group, saying our cheerful hellos as we passed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big surprise of the afternoon came when I came around a corner and in the middle of the bridge ahead of me was a Spectacle Bear! It saw me and quickly headed the other direction, while I fumbled to try to unclip my camera.  It moved off the path but Fernando advised us to just be quiet and wait.  Soon we saw it again climbing across the limb of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/speckled_bear.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide had told us about the bear earlier, and we knew that it is one of two bears in the world that are vegetarian.  He also said that this was only the second time in 25 years that he had seen one up close like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit further along we arrived at the first part of the trail where we started to climb toward the Sun Gate.  Then we walked some more and came to the second part of the ascent, and then we arrived at the really hard part.  You can get a good idea of how steep this was and a view of my best side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/brad_monkey_climb.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought we would be there but we still had 10 more minutes of walking and another bunch of stairs yet!  But when we finally got to the end it was so worth it!  And we had the view all to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/sun_gate_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking in the view, we moved off to the side where we could site on a nice ledge and have a snack and continue to enjoy the view.  At this point the group of nine, that we had passed at some point during the day, came through the Sun Gate as well.  We exchanged greetings and discovered that the group was from Minnesota and Iowa.  This led to what part of Minnesota, what part of Iowa questions etc.  When I said that we had recently moved to Minneapolis from Decorah, I heard a voice say “Brad!?” And this was the second big surprise of the day.  Sure enough two of the People in this group were Kurt and Paula Meyer, fellow Luther alumnus and Paula had also been chair of the board of Regents when I served as faculty representative!  Amazing!!  Four Luther alums on the Inca Trail arriving at the Sun Gate within minutes of each other.  What are the chances?  Sounds like a data science question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/luther_machu_picchu.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered that we were staying at the same hotel that night, so we said our temporary good byes and we all headed down the final part of the trail.  Along the way down we had our third big surprise.  Jane was using her hiking poles and poked a viper.  Our guide advised us to hurry on by and not pause to take any pictures of the poison snake.  So we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the bottom we still had to take a bus further down the mountain to Agua Caliente and then a short walk to our hotel, the Inkaterra.  At checkin we had the option of the 6:00 or the 8:00 seating for dinner.  We thought that maybe a dip in the hot springs (Agua Caliente) would be a good way to relax and rest up for the 8:00 dinner.  But by the time we had our complimentary Pisco Sour and chatted about our day with bob and Bonni, we decided that we didn’t have the energy to make it until 8:00.  So we switched to the 6:00 seating and we are so glad we did.  We were so tired and sore from our day of hiking that we were laying in bed reading by 8:00!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we go back to Machu Picchu to get an up close look!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Peru"></category></entry><entry><title>Into the Sacred Valley</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/sacred-valley.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2019-01-20:/PelicanBlog/sacred-valley.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the Amazon rain forrest to the heights of Cusco and the sacred valley.  We are acclimating ourselves in preparation for Machu Picchu, but are amazed and surprised by the beauty and history of this area.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The flight from Puerto Moldenado was blissfully short.  It was almost comical how many first time fliers seemed to be on our plane.  When we left the runway there were gasps of joy and cheers all over the plane.  There were also a lot of children making a lot of noise.  Jeez I sound like some cranky old man!  But we had barely leveled off before we were getting ready to land again.  It was a 40 minute flight but according to Maps a 9 hour drive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were met by our friendly guide Fernando who will be with us for our time around Cusco.  He had water waiting for us — Hydration is important at altitude as well as a nice hot cup of Coca tea.  Also good for helping you get acclimated.  Today we were just going to see a bit of the Sacred Valley, a local market and have a bite to eat before checking in to our hotel — Luna y Sol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows the spectacular view of one of the many valleys we saw.  The whole base of the valley is filled with CORN FIELDS.  They have a huge variety of corn, purple, yellow, red, white and other colors, and the kernels are the size of marbles.  It a very important part of the local environment, and they even brew beer with it called Chicha.  We have yet to try Chicha, I think it is mostly for the locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/corn_valley.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a little shopping at the local market where Jane bought a hand made silver necklace, and we enjoyed a delicious meal...  It seems there is no avoiding chicken and rice in Peru.  Thankfully they cook it in many different ways!  We checked in to the hotel and were immediately captivated by the Jacuzzi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our schedule for the next day was for our guide to pick us up at the very reasonable hour of 8AM!  This day we had three amazing stops.  First was a textile demonstration at a women’s cooperative in Chinchero.  It was fascinating to see the hand weaving and how much work goes into making blankets, and belts, and sweaters, and yes ponchos.  it may not have been the smartest purchase I ever made, but if you see me wearing it around the cabin or the city you will know that I am wearing a hand made, waterproof, Alpaca poncho.  Don’t worry, I didn’t buy the hat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Brad Poncho" src="/images/Peru/poncho_brad.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was the terraces of Moray.  I was not prepared for this at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Moray Terraces" src="/images/Peru/terraces.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were they made by Aliens?  What were these for?  Who made them?  According to our guide these were constructed by the Inca people between 1000 and 1400.  Research indicates that these terraces were actually agricultural laboratories!  By studying the DNA in the soil they have found that they were learning how to grow many different varieties of potatoes at different altitudes!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It blows me away sometimes to think about the knowledge that we have lost over time.  When the Spanish conquered the Inca king and subdued the people and stopped their work, think of the progress and the knowledge that was lost.  I’ve had this same thought in many parts of the world such as Pompeii. It makes me appreciate Google’s mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful.  It also makes me wonder what could cause the loss of all of the information stored in the Google database?  What could cause a similar collapse of a technological empire such as the world we live in today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that Inca is not really the proper term for the people, the Incas were the rulers the people were Quechua.  Our guide explained that it would be like calling all of the Egyptians Pharos.  I’m sure we will learn a lot more of their history when we visit Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the terraces we continued on to the Maras salt pans.  Here we saw 5000 small salt pans where people make salt that comes from a salty spring.  Deep in the Andes there is a giant salt deposit that this water works its way through, it then flows down this valley and through the many pans that people have created over the years to make salt.  Nowadays they actually make more money from tourism than salt, but I can’t help but think that is a short term setback until some marketer comes along and makes Peruvian Pink salt the next hot commodity for home gourmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/salt_pans.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we finished with all of this it was time for a late Peruvian lunch (2pm) which we enjoyed in the company of our guide and driver all the while just looking at the mountains that surrounded us on all sides.  It really is beautiful here in the Sacred Valley!&lt;/p&gt;

Here is what we learned and saw...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is a vacation not a vacation?  When you are on your third day in a row getting up between 4 and 5 AM.  It turns out that the animals are on a little different schedule than we humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first morning at Tambopata we had to be in the boat at 4:30 to head to the island where we were going to observe the Colorado Clay lick.  We were literally up before the birds in order to watch the birds have their breakfast.  It turns out that the best theory for why the birds in this area lick the clay is that it is like a vitamin supplement, providing additional sodium and other minerals in their environment that they do not get from the other stuff that they eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set up our viewing point across a narrow branch of the river from the clay and settled in on our stools before the sun came up.  We had a bit of coffee to keep comfortable (and awake) as we listened to mostly the silence and waited.  Soon the sun started to rise and we spotted a pair of Capibaras swimming in the channel, soon the the silence was broken by a few bird calls which continued to build and build until it was a raucous cacophony of Parrot and Macaw sounds!  We saw thousands of Parrots and small green Macaws, we also saw many of the large reds and the blue and greens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/claylick.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned from the clay lick in time for breakfast and a short break before our morning hike to the river overlook.  Before we left we were lucky enough to get to watch the Macaw researchers climb the tree containing two Macaw chicks.  These are part of their preservation research and so every couple of days they take the chicks out of the nest, weigh and measure them to make sure they are thriving.  Macaws are not worried about the humans touching their chicks!  In fact part of their research has shown that they will willingly adopt the chicks of other Macaws that are unable to care for their babies.  Occasionally the Macaws will have 3 or even 4 eggs, however they are only able to forage for enough food for two chicks.  So the last to be born are ignored.  These researchers obtained permission to transplant these third or fourth children to nests where there is only one or even zero babies.  The researcher told us about a nest that was struck by lightning and both babies were killed.  After a time they moved two chicks into the care of the bereaved parents and after some initial confusion on their part the parents started to care for the new chicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/macaw_chicks.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next image is of the parents of the baby keeping a careful watch on the researcher who climbed up to the nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/watchful_parents.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never know what you are going to see on one of the jungle hikes, Today we saw a lot of butterflies and Macaws and spiders, some particularly rare bird that our guide was super excited about but didn’t seem that interesting to me.  It was also super hot and really humid!  It was all really interesting and once we got to the river we were treated to some great views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/river_selfie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that we were going to rest during the shorter afternoon hike and conserve our energy for the night hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jungle walk in the dark was very cool.  We stopped at one spot that we had walked by many times on the way to and from the river to observe a tarantula nest!  Yikes!  I can’t believe we walked by there all those times.  I think there are millions of things in the jungle that we walk by all the time without noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also saw some pretty cool insects and even a scorpion hiding in the bark of a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/katydid.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/tarantula.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the night hike we had to get our bags packed and outside our door so the porters could have them loaded onto the boat for our 5:15 AM departure back to civilization the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip back down the river went much faster than the trip up the river — we were going with the current after all.  We saw a beautiful sunrise and had a very relaxing ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Peru/river_sunrise.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are really glad that we made the effort to visit and appreciate this amazing part of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun Fact&lt;/strong&gt;
One of these trees served as the model for the trees in the movie Avatar, the other is inspired by the trees in Avatar. I’m sure you can guess which is which?  We were lucky to see both of them in the span of two months.

We spent a very short night in the airport hotel, just across the street from the airport.  `After five hours of sleep we had a quick breakfast and headed back across the street where we flew to Cusco and then onward to Puerto Maldonado.  We were met outside the gate by our guide where we took a short transfer to the boat and a few hours later we were in the rain forrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained for most of our boat ride to the lodge, but by the time we arrived it was clearing.  This meant that we could do the hike to the observation tower.  A 120 foot high tower that lets you observe all the different layers of the jungle canopy, including from high above where you can see for miles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Canopy View" src="/images/Peru/canopy_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were enjoying our view we were joined by a clan of howler monkeys!  It was amazing to watch them from above, climb through the trees and then finally up one of the support cables to the observation tower.  We were a little worried they might start coming up the stairs but they kept right on moving and climbed down the wire on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Howler Monkeys" src="/images/Peru/howler_monkey.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at dinner as a group, along with our guide at 7:30 and by 8:45 we were in bed.  We were tired from the travel and we had a 4AM wake up for the next morning to head out to the lake and then onward for another 5 hours up the river to the Tambopata Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never heard howler monkeys its really quite a thing!  About 5AM we heard a sound that was just like an approaching windstorm.  That is the sound that howler monkeys make in the morning to mark their territory. Incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short boat ride we had about a 30 minute hike to the ox bow lake where we would go in search of the Anaconda (Still looking), the Caiman (a Peruvian alligator - also still looking), many birds, and do some fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you may be wondering what do you fish for in the Amazon? Piraña of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Piraña Fishing" src="/images/Peru/brad_fishing.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks a lot like a Sunfish at first glance.  At least until you get a close up look at the teeth!  Also, you do not typically use raw beef when fishing for Sunnies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our fishing excursion we were back on the river headed to our final destination for the day, which is the Tambopata Research Center.  This is one of the only places in the national reserve that you can stay overnight and learn about the jungle.  It is really an amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we were keeping our eyes peeled for interesting wildlife sightings.  We were richly rewarded when one of the crew spotted a Jaguar.  Right out in the open sunning itself!  It’s by far the best “big cat” siting we have ever had in all our travels, and I was thrilled to get some good shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jaguar Sunning" src="/images/Peru/sunning_jaguar.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jaguar in shade" src="/images/Peru/shady_jaguar.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final treat for the day we saw a bunch of Macaws at the “clay lick”. More on clay licking tomorrow after we learn more!&lt;/p&gt;

Hmmm?  Would you turn left and head into the rocks here?  Despite the giant arrow made of rocks right in the middle of the path it is really easy to miss.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/ladder_start.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when you realize this is the start its a little hard to believe that this is a real trail. But it doesn’t take long before you find the first ladder and then you know you are on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ladders" src="/images/ladder_ladder.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you get into the narrow slot canyons and you can really enjoy the hike.  Even though this is not a well marked hike so you might feel a little like you are heading into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ladder slots" src="/images/ladder_slots.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The going is a bit slow but when you arrive at the top you are rewarded with a great view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ladder view" src="/images/ladder_groupie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way down is much wider and more open through the beautiful painted canyon.  This was a great way to spend part of our last day of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="painted canyon" src="/images/painted_canyon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this hiking tradition ever since we saw the &lt;code&gt;#optoutside&lt;/code&gt; from REI a few years ago on Thanksgiving.  Tomorrow we’ll continue the tradition at Joshua Tree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Post Bike Tour Quiz</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/post-bike-tour-quiz.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2018-11-27:/PelicanBlog/post-bike-tour-quiz.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quiz for you after our bike tour&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What country would you be in if I told you the following facts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% of the people are home owners, 10% are renters and 0% are homeless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no unemployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possession of a firearm is a capital offense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possession of drugs is a capital offense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal helthcare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot buy alchohol (except in a bar) between the hours of 10pm and 7am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a job lined up your are welcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are a refugee you are out of luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you will pay around 20% of your salary for social security and your employer will contribute another 17% but you don't pay any income tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to buy an Audi plan on spending around a half million dollars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will not see any trash in the streets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can leave your bike unlocked or your purse on the table and nobody will steal it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home to the world's second busiest port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought I was describing some &amp;quot;commie socialist dictatorship&amp;quot; you would be wrong.  If you said Singapore, you are correct.  I will admit that all of these facts come from our most excellent bike tour guide from Urban Adventures, so some of it could be &amp;quot;fake news&amp;quot; or just a simple embellishment by someone who is very proud of their country. I haven't fact checked any of it yet.  But for as much as we saw some pretty cool parts of Singapore today we heard a lot that really made us think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Singapore/finance_district.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Wall Street area of Singapore at night.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the banner picture gave it away before you even read the question?  The Marina Bay Sands hotel is the largest in Singapore and has some very distinctive architecture.  A ship on top of the three towers, the hotel is owned by the Sands hotel in Las Vegas.  It's a massive hotel with a casino and mall and botanical gardens and a very distinctive architectural landmark of Singapore.  Honestly, the Asian and Middle-Eastern architecure we have seen on this trip make America seem really boring.  Hey, lets &amp;quot;make American architecture great again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons there is no homelessness is that the government provides social housing.  For as little as $30 / month for those who qualify you can rent a small 600 square foot apartment.  To qualify for the next level of social housing, you have to be married and at least 21 years old in order to qualify for social housing if your job is paying less than $90,000 / year.  that may seem like a lot, but it is the average income for Singapore.  Once you are in at this level you can stay in for life if you want.  Or you can even make improvements and sell your place for a profit later when you want to move into even more expensive private housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Singapore/river_garbage.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;They even have a special boat to scoop up the garbage that gets into the river from the storm sewers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is run like a large multi-national corporation.  The president makes 4 million a year and if you are elected you can expect to make about a million per year.  Our guide put it this way, if you pay peanuts you will only get monkeys.  Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Singapore/clarks_quay.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Clarks Quay from the night boat tour.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is all true of a country that has a total population of around 5 million people and is only 278 square miles in size -- That is a bit smaller than New York City. It is home to the world's second busiest port and the world's number one airport.  The government is run like a business to make money and last year they were 9 billion in the black.  I think its easy for an American to look at this wistfully and say what can we learn?  Why can't we be more like this?  But I think that is a pretty complicated question that brings into focus our freedoms and our history.  I'd be happy to outlaw guns, but I'm not sure sure we should turn away refugees and others in search of a better life.  I definitely wouldn't want to pay half a million for my Audi!  But I would support more use of mass transit and more biking in our cities.&lt;/p&gt;

Island</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/Bond-James-Bond-Island.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-11-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2018-11-23:/PelicanBlog/Bond-James-Bond-Island.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A fairly typical day on a swimming and snorkeling expedition, except that we are in Phuket Thailand!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wrong side of the island, wrong end of the beach!  That would be the headline for the way our trip started this morning.  We got off the ship with a group of 13 that had banded together through Cruise Critic to head off on a swimming, snorkeling and boating trip together.  However, it was a bit chaotic at the start.  While we could have anchored on the side of the island by the marinas we instead anchored on the other side of the island.  And while our guide knew the beach we were supposed to tender into he was informed that we would be tendering to the other end of the beach.  So when we got off and started looking for the sign that read &amp;quot;Jane Miller Group&amp;quot; we were suprised to not see one.  One taxi driver that had wanted to sell us a tour ended up being particularly nice when he offered to let us use his phone to contact the tour company.  They were at the wrong end of the beach which was a long long walk, so they said we should walk to the &amp;quot;family mart&amp;quot; and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Phuket/cave_group.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before we even got to the family mart one of our new friends said &amp;quot;Jane, here's your van&amp;quot;. Sure enough there was a driver with a &amp;quot;Jane Miller&amp;quot; sign.  Unfortunately he didn't have enough room for all of us in the van.  So Jane said I should go with the main group and she would wait for a car and ride with our new friends Mike and Karen.  Mike is an old army vet who now works as a defense contracter in South Korea teaching war gaming, and Karen is from Austin MN. Although there is a bit of an age gap, we have a lot in common and they were fun to talk to and always up for an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was forty five minutes later when we finally arrived at the marina and I had just pulled out my phone and turned on the international plan so I could text jane and find out where she was!?  Before I could press the send button however I noticed that she and Mike and Karen were all waiting for us on the sidewalk!  OK, mission accomplished, we are all at the marina we can get this show underway.  After a short trip to the nearby souvenier store where we paid double the usual cost for our Thai beers and we were ready to board our pink carriage to the boat halfway down the pier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our pre-trip briefing, both the owner and our guide for the day assured us that we were going to be back to the dock in plenty of time because they didn't want anyone to stress about making it back on time for the last tender back to the ship.  Great!  This sounds good.  There is nothing I hate more than wondering if we are going to make it back before the ship leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Phuket/phangngabay.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;This one was taken by our guide using his drone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half hour later we were at our first stop and in the 85 degree water.  Very nice and warm for swimming especially after all of our rushing around this morning and then sitting close together (with life jackets on!! to appease the local authorities) for the first part of the journey.  Life jackets were now stowed away for the rest of the trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Phuket/bayerosion.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the many beautiful islands in the bay.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the swimming we motored to a group of islands called Phang-Nga bay.  These islands were beautiful and reminded us of our time in Halong Bay, Vietnam.  We stopped at Ice Cream cave and went spelunking! It was really pretty and brought us through the island where we could see the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Phuket/cave_end.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled up to a small beach at a national park for lunch.  We had a fabulous Thai lunch.  By the time we finished lunch it was after 2pm and our guide said we would see James Bond island, the floating village and then do some kayaking before making our way back to the marina at high speed but still an hour away.  A few of us began to wonder out loud about the 4:00 return time. It turned out that the tide had gone out and the water was quite shallow to get to the floating village so we had to go slow.  I think it was at that point that our guide finally re-did the math in his head and announced that we should choose whether we wanted to see the village or Kayak.  None of us could see that Kayaking made any sense, given that we would have had about 5 minutes time to do so.   In reality we should have headed back right after James Bond island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Phuket/bond_island.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The island from James Bond: The Man with the Golden Gun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we arrived back at the marina closer to 4:30 and we could tell they were wanting us to really hurry to get to the vans and on our way back to the ship.  Given that it had taken 45 minutes to get there in the morning I was wondering how this was going to end.  fortunately our afternoon driver seemed to know a much better route than our morning driver and it really only took 20 minutes to get back, so all was well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days like today are my one knock against cruises like this.  You just don't really have enough time to do the things you'd like to do without the pressure of going right up against getting on board at the last second.  This was true for us in Kuala Lumpur as well as there was a whole hour long drive from the port just to get into the city.  When you do a land tour you don't have those daily deadlines, and you can take your time exploring a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it was &amp;quot;white night&amp;quot; on the ship tonight and we got back in plenty of time to enjoy the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stand under the clock tower facing the roundabout at 9:00 and my husband will find you.  Those were our instructions from Pearly, our instructor for the day.  So we did, Jane and I plus our two friends Rob and Joan.  Pearly's husband was a bit surprised to find Rob and Joan with us, but there was room in the class and it was no problem.  Just a couple of more things to pick up at the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Penang/fresh_chicken.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The chickens were super fresh.  Killed in one room (barely out of sight) and served right next door.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chanda, Pearly's husband drove us to the market where we waited for Pearly to arrive with the rest of the class.  Then our lessons started.  She did a great job of showing us around the market introducing us to all of the Malaysian produce.  She was particularly focused on educating us about the various health benefits of all of the different kinds of root vegetables.  By the time it was over I actually kind of wanted to eat a healthier diet with more greens and veggies.  You read it here first folks!  We also had the opportunity to try some great street food, including some peanut pancakes and some rice hoppers that were made with noodles, cane sugar, and coconut.  Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A street vendor preparing our peanut pancakes. Delicious!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market tour we drove to Pearly and Chanda's home where she gave us a tour of the garden and then brought us to our cooking stations.  Since Jane and I were the first to sign up for the class we got to choose the dishes to make!  We made three dishes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curry Kapitan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sambal Goreng -- Prawns in Cashew nut sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ngor Hiang Lor Bak - 5 spice pork roll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these is the traditional Penang curry that we eat back home, but they are all traditional Nyonya dishes.  Pearly is a fifth generation chinese living in Penang and they are the Nyonya.  Over the years of cooking for the British they developed a style of cooking that was very flavorful but not as spicy as their Thai counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Penang/chef_brad.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each step of the work we washed everything thoroughly in a large bowl of fresh water at each of our stations.  This was a little different than how I had cooked before, but the produce was all fresh and so whether it was to make sure we coaxed out any weavels hiding in the nuts or just to make sure we rinsed away any extra dirt or other nasty matter from the lemon grass or dried chilis or Galangal roots it seemed like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first started it seemed like we might be in an episode of &amp;quot;worst cooks&amp;quot; as some of our classmates immediately knocked their ingredients on the ground and started cutting things up all wrong.  But Pearly had pretty good humor about it and we spent most of our time laughing.  She did go a little overboard at one point grabbing the spoon out of Jane's hand in a misguided effort to &amp;quot;save her peppers&amp;quot; after her instructions about what to do were not entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't finish cooking and eating until 2:00 in the afternoon, but the time went by very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

Or is this a preview of retirement years?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On our first day at sea we looked at the schedule of activities on board the ship and Jane said, &amp;quot;We should go take a bridge lesson.&amp;quot; Having tried to learn bridge before I thought it sounded like a fun idea, maybe it would stick this time.  So we showed up at the appointed time of 10AM and there were a bunch of us.  We were among the youngest but certainly not the only people in our age bracket.  Our teacher was named Rhoda, clearly a longtime New Yorker. Also a lifelong teacher, she taught reading for most of her career.  Most of the other beginners had never even played cards before so I have to give them credit for starting with Bridge.  All our nights of 500 were a definite advantage in the playing phase of Bridge.  We didn't even start learning how to bid until the second lesson, but before we knew it we were adding high card points, learning about 5 card major openings, Jacoby transfers, Staymen, forcing bids, no trump responses, and the other conventions of American Standard bridge bidding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Seadays/rhoda.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;This is Rhoda.  She was a great teacher and really funny!  If I can remember her little memory ditties for remembering all the bridge strategy she taught us I might actually get good someday.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After bridge I was off to check out the cooking class for Indian Butter Chicken, and Jane was headed to water color painting class.  I turned out that I had misread the time for the cooking class, but at least I got to taste the result and get the recipe! I also wanted to check out the trivia challenge and then sing with the Highseas Choir. (get it high-C's).  I showed up at trivia at 12:15 and was invited to join a couple from Canada to see if we could form a team, we were soon joined by Beverly (a librarian!) and so it was that on our first day we had a team of four, which everyone else was at 8!  Unsurprisingly we were second to last after the first day.  However in this progressive trivia challenge the points double each day.  So on the next day I made Jane join in, and little by little we grew our team, and our scores increased and we moved up the rankings.  By the last day we were in second place!  One part of our strategy was to make use of the fact that you can request categories. I requested computer programming and cooking.  The &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot; question the next day was &amp;quot;What does HTTP stand for?&amp;quot;. Ha!  Only two of us in the room knew the answer to that one.  Its not really a programming question if you ask me, but I'll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in second place on the last day, we knew it was still almost anybody's game as the points that day were worth more than all the previous days put together.  But after the questions were in, and they read through the answers we realized that we had only missed two and many other teams were not cheering too much as the answers were read.  When it was all added up we won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Seadays/trivia-champs.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Our first place certificate, but we got a bag full of other Azamara swag; including a cup, a keychain, a t-shirt, a microfiber cloth... you get the idea.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane made three watercolor paintings on the ship during her painting lessons, and I think she should keep it up.  There must be someplace in Minneapolis to take some art lessons to keep improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Seadays/artshow.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the days at sea went by very quickly, and we had planned really great meals in the specialty restaurants on board for most evenings at sea.  After dinner we did enjoy some of the shows.  Except for the hypnotist.  I volunteered to be one of the 10 to be hypnotized but my brain is just way to busy to enter a trance in a situation like that (or maybe ever).  I was quite convinced that I could not be hypnotized before I even walked up there which meant I wasn't a good volunteer to begin with.  So no surprise  I was the first volunteer to be dismissed.  He insisted on having 10 volunteers so I figure he is just playing the odds that a certain percentage of the population is susceptible/able to be hypnotized and some are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also sang in the choir, which was fun, but at the end of it all we were not very good.  You have to listen to each other to sing, and most people in the choir were not good listners.  Still it does make me want to get my voice back in shape and join a choir back in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The front of the ship, known as the Living Room (or the Library according to Jane) was a favorite hangout in the late afternoon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about this Azamara journey is that the ship stays for three nights in Yangon (old Rangoon) which allows some of the more adventurous travelers the opportunity to do an overnight trip to the interior of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).  Our friends Ann and Jerry got us very excited about seeing the temples of Bagan so this was the perfect opportunity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Myanmar/balloon_group.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;sixteen people to a balloon in the early morning over the temples of Bagan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane worked with Trufflepig travel agency to plan our days to get the most out of the adventure. Which we definitely did as we were off the ship early on our first morning in port and were were among the very last handful of passengers to board less than an hour before we sailed away from Myanmar! Our first day was a fairly nice tour of Yangon.  The main attraction is the huge gold covered Schwedagon Pagoda.  They were in the midst of a project they do every five years to replace the gold plating on the dome of the pagoda.  We saw families dressed in their finest bringing a 10 by 10 inch plate of gold to place in a small cart that would go by wire up to the dome where it would be put in place.  This must be the most expensive pagoda in the world, as the very tip of the pagoda is encrusted with diamonds, rubies and sapphire gems worth millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense of the pagoda stands in stark contrast to everything around it.  It seems that people are giving away their life savings to decorate this place.  Its a part of the culture that I would definitely like to understand more about.  I should also point out that Myanmar is also fairly well endowed with gold mines, diamond mines as well as mines containing rubies and sapphires.  But like many of our other stops there is also a huge amount of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight to Bagan was about an hour aboard a propjet plane, and we were met by our guide, Mr. Htay, and driver for our time in Bagan for the short five minute ride to the Aureum Palace Hotel.  A beautiful 5 star hotel where the bathroom in our villa was bigger than our entire stateroom on the ship!  The dining and pool areas of the hotel overlook several smaller pagoda (pagodas? pagodi?).  Although it was still only around 7pm we ate dinner at the hotel.  The menu was a very international menu including burmese, Thai, Italian, and American fare.  Our server recommended anything from the Thai menu as the chef was from Thailand and very good.  I had the Pad Bai Kra Prao Gai -- something I'm determined to cook at home.  its a bit similar to Laarb but spicy instead of bright and fresh.  Its ground chicken mixed with spices and spicy basil served over rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner it was early to bed, partly because I was suffering from a nasty cold and partly because we knew we had a 4:40 alarm set to get up for our balloon ride the next morning!  I slept well until 2AM and then spent the rest of the night tossing and turning waiting for that early alarm to go off, and anticipating the balloon ride!  See the gallery at the end of this post for a bunch of photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We travelled to the launch site in a Carbus!  The Carbus is a vehicle that was made in Canada and used by the Allies in World War II.  At the end of the war there were 206,000 of these vehicles in Burma but it was too expensive to ship them all back home so they were just left here.  Over the years the burmese have restored them, replaced and engines, and used them for various purposes.  The windows were open air, or you could pull up some wooden shutters to block the early morning breeze which we did since it was the first time since leaving home that we were a bit chilly. (it was probably 69 degrees out)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Myanmar/balloon_temple.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Seeing the temples from the air was one of the highlights of the whole trip.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the launch site in darkness where they had coffee and tea waiting for us and then it was on to our safety briefing.  As the sky began to turn gray in the east the safety briefing was over and it was time to inflate the balloons!  What a fascinating process, to watch them start up fans and then run around inside the balloon making sure everything was in place.  After the balloons were about three quarters inflated they started the burners and started shooting flames into the balloon, which very quickly became upright and ready for us to board!  There were sixteen passengers in four compartments of the basket.  The pilot, Fernando, was in the middle with his tanks of fuel and his ipads to show the wind speeds at various altitudes.  it took a lot of hot air to get all seventeen of us into the air, but it was so gentle and amazing that you didn't even realize you were leaving the ground.  Once airborn we were all just mesmerized by everything!  temples in every direction and the sun just peeking over the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were probably in the air for a little over an hour and I alternated between madly taking pictures trying to capture the experience and just leaving my camera hanging so I could fully enjoy the experience!  There were 23 balloons in the air that morning and part of the beauty of the experience was seeing all of the other balloons around us.  It was all over too quickly when we landed (on our second attempt) in the middle of a field.  Our pilot had to hold a delicate balance between letting the balloon deflate a bit versus keeping it upright enough so that the basket didn't tip and drag until the ground crew caught up with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got out of the balloon we celebrated our journey with an early morning champagne toast.  The first balloon flight was in the Champagne region of france so apparently this is a tradition followed after all balloon flights.  Our pilot got into ballooning when he got fed up waiting for parts for an ultralight plane.  Now he owns his own company in Spain, and spends five months of the year in Bagan doing balloon rides and five months in the south of france doing balloon rides.  Quite an interesting life if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the balloon we returned in our Carbus to the hotel where we cleaned up, had breakfast and then met our guide for our eBike tour of the temples of Bagan. the eBike was a great way to explore the backroads around the temples.  We explored a few that were off the beaten path and getting a bit overgrown, and then we saw a few of the popular ones that we had seen from the air.  It was really interesting to have a good guide for this part of the trip as the walls of the temples are like history books.  The different paintings and the stories they all tell always make me wish I had done more homework before visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Myanmar/temple.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Temples all have a North, South, East and West facing Buddha at the entrance.  The biggest and fanciest have two square corridors, an inner and outer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Myanmar/eBikes.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Seeing the temples on an electric scooter is the way to go!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of &amp;quot;templing&amp;quot; we drove our scooters to a monastery and had a huge burmese lunch.  It is said that one of the kings in Bagan never had a meal with less than 300 dishes.  We had 30.  The traditional meal is to have a main curry and rice dish and then many many side dishes.  We had two different beef curries and one chicken curry.  That leaves 27 different side dishes.  From tofu to pickled bean sprouts to mashed gooseberries to spicy toasted nuts.  We managed to try a bit of everything between us.  Many of them we didn't like at all because they were just too bitter for our western taste buds.  I'm not sure that even my friend (JMS) would have cleaned up all the food they served us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Myanmar/lunch.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Lunch at the monestary. You can see all of the side dishes we had around the outside of the circle.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about our guide was that he didn't overdue the temples.  After lunch he said we could continue if we wanted or we could go back to the room for some rest and refreshment before he picked us up at 4:00 for our carriage ride and sunset watching.  We opted for resting and trying out the rum sour drinks from the hotel bar that our guide had recommended we sample.  They were very refreshing all on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carriage ride was very peacful and the sunset was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Myanmar/sunset.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset over the temples&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sunset we were beat, so we had an early dinner by the pool and enjoyed the
reflection of the nearby temples in pool.  It was another early night to bed as we knew we were off to the airport first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one worry about the hole Bagan adventure had been that we were not leaving ourselves a very good safety margin for getting back to the ship at the end of it all.  Our flight was schedule to arrive at 10:10 and the roads and traffic in Yangon are so bad that it takes at least an hour and a half to drive from the port to the airport.  With our ship leaving at 1:00 I would have liked a bit more time.  On top of that virtually everyone we met was flying back the night before for that very reason.  Of course they all missed the sunset.  So... when the time to board our plane passed and the ground crew told me that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to weather in Heho my stomach began to churn a bit.  My internal safety deadline of 11:00 was getting uncomfortably close.  Of course we knew that we had our passports and credit cards and more than a day to catch up with the ship in Phuket if we &amp;quot;missed the boat.&amp;quot; So there really wasn't anything to worry about.  But sometimes you still do even when you shouldn't.  Our plane landed at 10:50 and our guide was waiting for us.  He joked that they had the privte jet all fueled up and ready to take us to Phuket, but we made it back to the ship before it sailed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we got caught up in a traffic jam in the middle of the Yala National Park in Sri Lanka!  But it was for a good reason, a Leopard.  After many hours of bumping around the jungle in a jeep and seeing lots of different animals we still had not seen a leopard.  We really didn't expect to as it was hot and the middle of the day.  Most of the sane leopards were hidden away napping on tree branches.  We knew that something was up as soon as our driver hit the gas pedal.  We had learned over the course of the day that when he sped up and started driving like a madman it was because some other driver had seen something cool and it had come down their phone tree.  How they tell each other their position out there is something only they know, I think, as there are thousands of paths and zero road signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of flying along we ended up at the back of a very long line of jeeps going nowhere.  initially the word was that it was a crocodile, which didn't seem all that likely as a croc would not attract this much attention.  Eventually we learned that it was a Leopard! What a bonus that we were actually going to see one.  After nearly a half hour of inching forward one car at a time we were pointed in the right direction by several of the guides who were standing by the side of the road trying to keep everyone moving.  It was quite far in the distance but I did get a great view of it with the binoculars.  Unfortunately it was too far away for any kind of recognizability unless you really zoom in like below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/SriLanka/leopard.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone in the Jeep was so lucky and we learned a good lesson about traveling with tired and crabby people.  The poor driver was just doing his job and following instructions.  But after six hours in a jeep in 90 degree weather, it was a bit much for one couple who had been bickering with each other all day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a gallery of some of my favorite photos taken during the day.  Enjoy!  And if you ever get to Sri Lanka I recommend you plan a day like this.&lt;/p&gt;

Getting to drive the tuk tuk!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning we had a morning at sea and we arrived in Colombo Sri Lanka noon.  Jane had arranged a tuk tuk tour for us and several other people from the cruise critic message boards.  We made our way off the ship and negotiated a taxi to take us to the hotel where we were to meet our drivers and tuk tuks.  In case you've never experienced a tuk tuk it is a three wheeled vehicle with a motorcyle engine.  The driver sits in the front and 2 or maybe 3 passengers sit in the back.  These vehicles are all over in the cities of Asia and can drive in ways that cars cannot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/SriLanka/coconut_water.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Our tour started out with some delicious coconut water for us to sip as we drove around the city.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we noticed is what a different vibe there is in Colombo versus the cities in India.  The driving is more orderly, the city seemed quite well maintained from the lack of garbage in the streets to the upkeep of the buildings.  We visited a Buddhist temple, saw &amp;quot;the white house&amp;quot;, visited a Hindu temple, the national cricket grounds, and some of their national monuments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/SriLanka/tuktuk.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Enjoying the open air tour of Colombo aboard our tuk tuk with our driver &amp;quot;Big Show&amp;quot;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the highlight of the day was when we were on a pretty out of the way street and our driver pulled over and asked if I wanted to drive.  Now I'm not even a motorcycle driver, but that didn't deter me from giving it a shot.  Unlike a motorcycle the clutch is on the left and along with the shifting mechanism, the throttle is on the right hand along with the break.  I made it into first gear without any trouble and then paniced when I heard someone coming up from behind me.  I slowed down and forgot to engage the clutch.  Wah wah wah...  But then we started it up again and I was good for at least 1 kilometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest thing was that as we were motoring down the road with me driving we were passed by a policeman!  It was pretty clear to all concerned that I didn't have a license,  but he just smiled and continued on his way.  Jane was in the back making a video and thought the whole thing was quite funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/SriLanka/driving.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Brad, the Ace tuk tuk driver!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were at the national cricket grounds, I noticed that they had something called &amp;quot;Hoppers&amp;quot; on the menu.  So I asked our guide about it.  He explained that they were like crispy pancakes that you stuffed with different fillings and rolled up to eat.  A few minutes later he was on the phone and arranging for us to have hoppers on our lunch stop!  They were delicious.  We had some spicy filling called pol sambola to use with one plain hopper and one egg hopper.  Both were really good. Then we had a delicous chicken Kottu a mixture of roti and vegetables and chicken, served with a dark garlic curry.  We were running a bit behind schedule but we were all so glad that we got to experience this great food instead of rushing back to the ship to make the dinner buffet! For desert we had some delicious buffalo milk curd with honey drizzled on top.  Time to find a Sri-Lankan cookbook to see if I can recreate any of this at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;This sign says a lot.  Nobody reads it!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that no blogging about India would be complete without some comment on the driving!  It is a great example of both the chaos and cooperation present in the culture of India.  It is utter chaos in that although there are line lines painted on the roads, very few drivers seem to care.  Where there is only one lane you might find two or even three vehicles side by side depending on the size of the vehicles.  Passing?  No problem you can pull part way out of the lane to pass, the vehicle in front of you will probably move over a bit to the left and the oncoming traffic will likely move a bit to the right so you can get around!  I don't know what the statistics on traffic accidents or fatalities are in India, but amazingly we didn't see any during our visit to either Mumbai or Kochin.  I tried to make a video out the front of the bus as we were driving down the road and staring into an oncoming truck.  But it didn't turn out so you'll just have to trust me on this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our day in Kochin was mostly spent on a small bus studying the driving habits of the natives, but we did make two very interesting stops.  The first stop was to do a two hour ride on a large houseboat that took us through the canals and waterways of Kochin.  We got to see the countryside and the rice paddys.  It was really good to get out of the city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second interesting stop was at a small bridge where we could see the famous chinese fishing nets in action.  These nets have been in use for centuries and it was fascinating to see them catching and hauling in the fish.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First world problems eh?&amp;quot; We all use that phrase to acknowledge that when we are complaining about our iPhone being a little too slow, or our dinner selections not quite vast enough, we really do get that its not that important in the grand scheme of things.  Today, we experienced life in the slum of Mumbai known as Dharavi, and it put into perspective the distance between our first world problems and real life. I don't think I'll use that phrase anymore as it feels like it doesn't come close to recognizing the challenges faced by those living outside the first world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Mumbai/washing.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Washing the clothes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane arranged our tour of Mumbai through a tour group called reality tours.  They were excellent and I would highly recommend you use them if you ever visit Mumbai.  Not only are the guides excellent but 80% of the proceeds from your tour dollars go straight into their community.  Their community happens to be in one corner of the Dharavi slum.  I was absolutely floored to learn that our tour guide for the day lived in the slum!  I thought that slums were only for the very most poor and destitute, surely not for someone who was educated, well spoken and hard working!  In fact we learned that many professionals such as teachers and policemen live in the slums of Mumbai.  This reality runs straight against our American ideals, but we were not in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Mumbai/communications.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The communications hub for the Dharavi slum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure that we breathed som pretty toxic fumes on the first part of our tour today.  The slum is divided into two parts, the commercial and the residential part.  In the commercial part it seemed that recycling was a huge part of the economy, both lastic and aluminum.  The plastic is broken down and then thrown into something that we Minnesotans would call a wood chipper, which breaks the plastic into smaller pieces.  These pieces are then melted down and extruded into long strings and finally cut into tiny little lengths which makes little plastic pellets.  These are then sold to manufacturers to be turned into who knows what.  The dust and smell from the plastic can not be good for you. The same basic process is used for aluminum only that requires a lot higher temperatures.  We saw a bunch of aluminum bricks that were so hot that people were cooking their lunch on them!  In all of this we saw no hard hats, no safety goggles, and no shoes.  We did see a lot of people working hard to earn money for their family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the residential area it was much different.  The &amp;quot;streets&amp;quot; were so narrow that my shoulders stretched from one side to the other.  The houses are quite small and for the most part families live together in a 10x20 foot room.  Our guide was 30 and still lives with his parents and siblings because he cannot afford his own place.  I learned that the average teacher's salary is the equivalent of $200 per month, so it is no wonder that housing is hard to afford. Later in the day our guide took us past the most expensive house in the world a 2+ billion dollar home built overlooking the sea owned by an indian billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the government tried to clean up the slums and built hi-rise apartments next door for people to move into, but they were so expensive that nobody could afford them and most ended up moving back.  Living in the slums is not free, people there pay taxes and rent and bills for water and electricity.  Water only runs for a few hours a day, although electricity is pretty constant.  Each home is metered for electrical use!  Although the wires are run so haphazardly I can't imagine how it is very accurate.  We were not allowed to take pictures as our guide explained we are in people's homes and want to respect their privacy.  Everywhere we went, we were greeted by the children.  They were all smiles and wanted to say hello to us, give us a high five or shake hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Mumbai/kids.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Friendly kids in Dharavi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stop on our journey was the laundry.  In a way this is similar to the slums in that people both live and work in the laundry.  This is where the washing is done for hospitals and hotels and clothing manufacturers. We were able to take pictures inside here. Each of these large bins is one small business, doing the washing for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its all so strange and different, like a step back in time in some ways.  Imagine that your hospital bedding was sterilized by throwing the sheets into a 50 gallon drum of water heated from below by an open flame!?  Ironing?  Of course they have ironing, have you ever seen an iron that is heated by coal? We saw some of them in use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, although this part of the day was really sobering.  We saw some fun and beautiful sites along the way too.  The Victoria train station was very grand, and our stop at the cricket field was very entertaining.  There must have been at least 100 different cricket games going on simultaneously.  We watched as balls were hit across two, three, or even more other games.  It seemed like total chaos to me, but it was clear that everyone was having a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Mumbai/cricket.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Cricket Chaos!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour also featured a stop for some street food!  We went to food stand at the beach owned by Bihm Singh, where we tried a number of different things. Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Dahi Ragda Puri.  The Pani Pur and Dahi Ragda were both served in crisp little balls, where the cook punched a hole in the top and then filled the ball with delicious spicy ingredients.  The Sev was more like a nacho in that it was a flat crispy bit of dough with the ingredients piled high.  The way you eat these is to pop it all in your mouth at once.  Jane got a fabulous photo of me demonstrating how to do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Mumbai/puri_making.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Making the Pani Puri&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell the whole place was run on some kind of honor system.  I never saw an order being written down, and yet people were eating all kinds of things chatting away and ordering and eating and chatting some more.  like much of what we saw it seemed very cooperative and trusting amongst all of the participants.  Such a different feel than you get in so many places back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the followup email from our guide sums up the day pretty well and since I've been struggling to put the day into words I'll just quote him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You have picked your way through Dharavi's narrow, winding lanes, and witnessed first hand the communal, enterprising spirit that allows so many people to survive and thrive despite the many issues that they face.  We hope you've left having had some of your perceptions about life here challenged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I can only say, &amp;quot;mission accomplished.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our guide's name was Oscar, He is a Masai from kenya, but immigrated to Dubai and works tours out of the port at Khor Fakkan.  We picked this excursion because we wanted to get out of the city and into the country side. We were not dissappointed.  We visited four different Emirates on our trip, but the main feature was when we got offroad and ventured through the Wadi.  A Wadi is more or less a dry streambed most of the time, except for when it rains.  And with less than 200 milimeters of rain a year that is not much rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Wadi/thinking.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Me, I was thinking about Jonah sitting under the tree outside of Ninevah.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The port of Khar Fakkan is not too developed yet.  And is mostly for container ships.  We had heard that it was a busy port but we were the only ship in port and there were not that many containers.  We have a good alternative theory that the port that is busy is just around the corner and is the port for all the tankers.  When we got a few miles away from the port we saw the oil tanks.  They have a huge pipeline that brings most of the oil from the emirates to this storage facility.  Its better to be here because the location is not as easily blockaded by Iran as other Emirate locations!  Miles and miles of huge oil tanks, all storing oil for every brand you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a quick stop at the friday market.  We were pretty sure that this market was just the best place they could find for a short stretch break on our way to the mountains!  Our guide said we could get out and look but not to buy anything because we didn't have any room in our jeep to haul it.  He was right, although we were in a big Land Cruiser we had our guide and six passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Wadi/friday_market.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the friday market.  Called that becuase friday was the day they were open and everyone gathered.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got to the offroad portion of the trip, Oscar became a bit upset because the lead car had taken a route he thought was sub-standard.  It kept us inside the wadi instead of the better view by driving along side and above it.  Finally when one car got stuck in a muddy rut (it had rained last week) he was not too happy, and both Jane and I were reminded of an earlier adventure when our airboat got stuck in the Everglades for three hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made a stop at a luxury hotel for lunch, and a very very short stop at the oldest mosque in the area.  Made of clay and quite small.  They were very strict about enforcing the clothing rules and since I had not heard about this part of the trip I was not allowed inside in my shorts.  I could have borrowed a long traditional robe, but our stop was so short that the guides were hurrying everyone to get back in the trucks before we really figured out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were getting back on the ship we figured out the reason why they were rushing us.  We were in the last truck as Oscar was clearly one of the more experienced guides and was trying to keep the younger drivers in front of him.  As we were going through security to get back on the ship one of the security guys was counting down. I was 8 and jane was 7 there were only six passengers (all behind us) unaccounted for before the ship could leave port.&lt;/p&gt;

We explore both sides of this place.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I once listened to an interesting 99% Invisible podcast that said that Las Vegas was the petri dish for architecture in the United States.  Las Vegas is also the city that keeps on coming to mind as I visit Dubai.  The variety of architecture here is just amazing, especially in the new areas of Dubai -- where by new I mean less than 20 years and in many cases less than 10 years old!  There are amazing buildings with modern architecture everywhere you look.  This place is on a mission to make a statement on a global scale.  But even after spending a couple of days here I'm not sure what that statement actually is.  &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; on our tour to the Hajar Mountains yesterday our guide said &amp;quot;Dubai is the Las Vegas of the middle east, just without the gambling&amp;quot;. So there are two data points for you on that comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Dubai/NightDhows.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A night time view of the creek with the dinner cruise dhows.  In the background you can see the Dubai Frame as well as the Burj Khalifa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put a positive spin on it it might be something like this:  Visionary leadership will get you everywhere.  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum definitely had a vision and the people here have executed on that vision.  Creating islands shaped like palm trees and soon home to two of the worlds tallest buildings where just 15 years ago there was nothing but flat desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slightly more cynical spin would be.  Dubai: we have more Guinness world records than anyone else, you should come shop here! The Mall of the Emeriates, The City Center Mall, the Marina Mall and of course the Dubai Mall, which is the largest mall in the world.  The new area of Dubai hosts all of the worlds tallest hotels (at least the top three) there is the worlds highest swimming pool, the worlds highest observation deck, the worlds tallest building, with the worlds fastest elevator, which will soon be supplanted by a different building that will overcome the soon to be completed tallest building in Saudi Arabia.  The worlds largest indoor ski area -- Yes it has real snow and operating lifts.  This will also be replaced by another indoor ski area with a much longer run.  The worlds largest man-made island.  Its really exhausting to see and list all of these records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Dubai/burjkhalifa_night.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A view from the 148th floor of the Burj Khalifa at night. Sadly, the remnants of a sandstorm reduced the daytime view to a gray haze.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the reason behind all of these records? You might be tempted to say that it is all due to oil wealth.  But Dubai is small and contains only 4% of the oil reserves in the UAE.   A little research will quickly lead you to the same reason I gave above, vision.  It was the vision of the leadship of Dubai that led to the creation of the infrastructure, mass transit, and tax systems that have caused massive economic growth.  Foreginers are allowed to own propery and business in designated business zones.  There is no income or sales tax which explains some of Dubai as a massive shopping destination.  And some things, like a man made island in the shape of a palm tree are just to show off a bit and attract celebrities to area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hotel was near the Dubai Creek which was dredged and extended as part of the massive building efforts.  But the creek is also the reason Dubais is located where it is.  It is a highly defensible port location which is still operating today.  Ports in Iran and many other Gulf countries are fairly close, just a 4 hour boat trip to Iran.  The Creek and the port are the intersection of the old and new Dubai as you can see clearly in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Dubai/loading_Dhows.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Loading the Dhow for its journey through the Gulf, with new Dubai in the background.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dhows are loaded with all kinds of goods from new and used electronics to fresh water and furniture to be shipped from Dubai to other countries.  The crime rate is so low that these goods basically sit here next to a busy street unguarded, waiting to be loaded and shipped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Dubai/waiting_abras.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see the &amp;quot;taxi&amp;quot; that we used to get from the new side of the creek to the old side of the creek.  The ride was just 1 Durham which is about a quarter.  You simply walk up, hop on and pay the driver his money.  Or a helpful local may grab your 5 give you change and pass on the bill to the driver!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of our visit was a middle-eastern food tour hosted by Stephanie of Frying Pan Adventures.  Stephanie is an Italian-Egyptian native of Dubai.  She took us around her old neighborhood where we sampled food from Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, Iran and Iraq.  Jane and I agreed that our favorite was the giant Felafel sandwhich from Sultan Dubai Felafel.  Eaten outside in the company of new friends it was delicious.  We then followed it up with Kunafa served in the kitchen of Qwaider al Nabulsi.  Kunafa is made with butter, noodles, salty cheese, and sugar syrup.  Cooked in a large pan to a golden brown and served fresh!  It was awesome.  We also were able to enjoy many different varieties of Baklava along with an amazing cream sauce made from Soaproot!  The egyptian pizza known as Feteer was also very good.  My least favorite was the slow smoked carp at the Iranian restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Dubai/kitchen_tour.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Making the Kunafa!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visit to Dubai has left us with more questions than answers but we look forward to exploring much more of the middle eastern and southeast asian cultures as we begin the cruise portion of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The plan was to go to Napa.  But we have been to Napa in fact we had been to Napa already this year.  So instead we decided to try Yosemite.  Its a lot further drive from Mountain View but we love our national parks and so this was a nice chance to take a long weekend break and visit someplace we had never visited before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most visits to a national park words don't do it justice and neither do my pictures, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a seemingly endless drive in traffic to get out of Mountain View and especially someplace called &amp;quot;Old Gilroy&amp;quot; we spent our first night in Oakville.  We arrived late, but just in time to get the last Pizza of the night from the friendly proprietor of Sugar Pine Pizza.  We were ready to set off for Mariposa grove in the morning to see the giant redwoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Yosemite/sequoia.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Grizzly Giant&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there we drove out to glacier point where we had a magnificent view of Half Dome.  This is definitely one of the highlights of Yosemite.  It is truly amazing, and the drop off from glacier point to the valley floor below is really breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Yosemite/halfdome.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Half Dome from Glacier Point&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a short hike at Glacier Point and then drove back and made a stop at the Sentinel Dome trailhead.  This would be our good hike for the day.  We wondered at first if we could really get to the top of Sentinel dome but we found that we could and the views were definitely worth it.  We were really tired after the hike and more than happy to check in to the Majestic Yosemite Inn.  Right there on the floor of the valley we had views of Half dome and El Capitan!  Because it was early fall the waterfalls were basically dried up so now we have a reason to go back again some spring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Sentinel Dome Selfie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we planned on hiking to mirror lake to see the morning views of Half Dome reflected in the clear calm waters.  Umm... Little did we know that mirror lake is becoming a Meadow.  Its part of the natural order of things, but it was a little disappointing after hiking two miles to find no water!  Usually we are so good at researching these things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had plenty of day left so we decided to make the drive to the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.  It has some good hiking too although we only did a little as it was super hot when we got there.  The reservoir is beautiful and its amazing to think that this reservoir supplies drinking water to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

With everything going on at the college, I really needed a few days away from school to clear my head and have some fun.  What better way to do this than with friends Tim and Sandra Peter at their home in Florida!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Noodling with Tim " src="/images/noodling_with_tim.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our delta flight was full of Disney bound kids (young and old) we arrived in Orlando ahead of schedule and headed to the Peter house.  I love thier house, its perfect Florida living with a beautiful covered Lanai and a pool that Tim heated up just for our arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't have a very full agenda for our time with the Peter's, sit by the pool, and visit Stetson were really the only two must do items on the list.  The sun and the pool were awesome.  So was the visit to Stetson.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a great dinner out at Hillstone restaurant in Winter Park.  I had great ribs, but Tim, Sandra and Jane all had Hawaiian Rib-eye steaks.  These were so good that I had to go find the recipe for the marinade and use it the next night on pork chops!  I'm really looking forward to trying this on steaks again on my Hasty Bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big learning from the trip to Orlando is that we are bascially not theme park people at this stage of our lives.  We enjoyed a few of the rides but mostly we though we would have more fun just hiking somewhere.  I guess this is a fine place to be in, and if we have grand kids someday then the enjoyment will be back as we get to watch them experience things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Friends"></category></entry><entry><title>Bula from Likuliku Lagoon</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/bula-from-likuliku-lagoon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-24T09:08:18-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-24T09:08:18-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2017-01-24:/PelicanBlog/bula-from-likuliku-lagoon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bure View" src="/images/bure_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a view like that you would think I could write something really inspirational for this final post of our journey.  Four weeks of travel with some absolutely crazy sights and adventures have wrapped themselves up here at the Likuliku Lagoon Resort in Fiji.  To put it mildly the resort is amazing.  A maximum of 96 guests, all adults, with a staff to guest ratio of about 2:1, maybe even 1:1 during the week here.  All of them greet you with a smile and the Fijian greeting of "Bula!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a few options for getting to the resort from Nadi:  A ferry that makes the rounds of the islands three times a day, a private water taxi, a seaplane, or even a helicopter.  But whenever and however you arrive you will be greeted on the island by a small band playing welcome music and many Bulas.  Your luggage is whisked away and you get a cold drink and a quick orientation session on everything the resort has to offer.  Kayaks, Standup Paddleboards, and sailboats are a few of the things you can do off the beach.  Every guest in the over-water Bures is issued a mask, fins and snorkel.  There is a ladder right off the deck so you can climb down and snorkel on the reef right outside your room!  The floor in the room has two windows so that you can sit on the couch and look through the floor at the water and the fish swimming below!  Or Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-afternoon, high tide, the water is practically bath tub temperature.  The variety of fish we have seen just  outside our Bure is astounding!  We saw: Unicornfish, Clownfish, Angelfish, Parrotfish, Tang, Moorish Idol, Butterflyfish, Blue Sea Star, a Blue-spotted  Ribbontail Ray, an Eagle Ray,  a big old Moray Eel and many more.  Many of these are also visible just standing on the deck and looking in the water!  But cooling off with a bit of snorkeling is even better.  At low tide you are not supposed to snorkel in front of your Bure as the water is shallow and the reef is protected.  But you can still see some pretty amazing sights from the deck and the walkway.  Check out the video of this huge school of sardines.   Watch as the bigger fish (a Trevaly) swims though and leaves empty space behind.  The Sardines are also a favorite snack for the Gar.  Every so often as you are sitting out on the deck a school like this will go crazy and start jumping out of the water for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don't think we have had better snorkeling anywhere in the world!  Plus the convenience of snorkeling off your own private deck just can't be beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dinner" src="/images/likuliku_dinner.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner time is really spectacular.  You are seated right along the water and at 7:00 you have a fantastic view of the sunset as you have your appetizer.  The menu is different every day and all the food is really good.  This morning I had an omelette stuffed with mud-crab meat!  For lunch we had grilled chicken with papaya salad and rice.  The chicken was so flavorful.    Our first night we had a feast of Indian and asian curries -- prawns, crab, lobster, chicken, and lamb!  Last night we had delicious steak.  For lunch yesterday I had fried rice with at least a dozen big prawns with a spicy breading.  I didn't expect to be eating gourmet food for every meal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other activities you can sign up for, such as taking a wave runner for a spin to some of the nearby islands.  You can go for a two hour picnic on a deserted island, you can take a tour of the island where they filmed Castaway.  Or you can just relax, which is really the purpose of our visit.  After going and going for three and a half weeks, these last few days are the vacation from the vacation!  Today's activities were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get up and have coffee on the deck with my iPad while watching the fish.  I'm trying to avoid Facebook because all of the articles and discussion about lying Donald is really depressing.  "Alternative Facts" for pete's sake stop!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk to the restaurant for breakfast -- delicious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;come back and lounge around in the shade on the deck while reading a novel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk to the restaurant for lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do some standup paddle boarding to work off the lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a shady spot by the infinity pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get in the infinity pool to cool off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return to the room for high tide and snorkeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open a bottle of wine for happy hour and pre-sunset drinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk to the restaurant for dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm exhausted just listing all of these things!  😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Infinity" src="/images/NZ/likuliku_pool.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we will spend the day here at the resort, then take the 4:00 ferry back to the main island and catch a cab to the airport.  Our Fiji airlines flight leaves tomorrow night at 9:40pm and we arrive 13 hours later,  the same day (well before we leave) in LA.  In fact we leave Fiji at 9:40pm on January 25th and we will arrive in Minneapolis at 9:00pm on January 25th.  Teleportation anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as little as I wanted to go to the stinky spa yesterday, Jane wanted to go to Hobbiton today even less.  She's not a big Lord of the Rings Fan.  But our guide told us that nearly 30% of the people who visit Hobbiton have never seen even one of movies nor have they ready any of the books.  Having seen all of the movies more than once and read the books, I was at the top of my class for our tour group of around 30 people. I think there were two of us that admitted to loving Middle Earth that much.   Do you recognize where I am standing in the picture above?  If you said Bag End, you are correct!  The home of Bilbo and Frodo.  I swear that even though I was with a very unruly tour group I could almost convince myself I was "really" there at times.  Oh, yes my vivid imagination.  Only slight eye roll from Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got there early thinking we might be able to get in on an earlier tour, but as we listened to the people who had not pre-booked their tour in front of us learn that the next available slot was 5:00 this afternoon or tomorrow we realized that we were going to have an opportunity to enjoy our crackers and cheese that we had been bringing with us for the last couple of days.  Crackers, cheese, meat and Ginger Beer, make a pretty good picnic.  I went into the gift shop to kill a little time and other than a bottle of Middle Earth wine, I was pretty much ready to leave immediately.  I was struck by the fact that they were selling "The One Ring" in multiple sizes!  (what!?) for only $190.00.   To be honest I knew this was coming because our tour guide, Robo, on the great ocean road told me he bought one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/NZ/signpost.jpg"&gt; Hobbiton is largely preserved as it was after it was rebuilt for the Hobbit trilogy.  Its amazing to me that for Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit there was less than 4 months of filming here.  Our tour guide told us several stories about how much Peter Jackson was obsessed with staying true to the book and keeping things logical.  For example we passed by some apple trees in a small grove, in the books this grove was described as plum trees.  So, Jackson made someone take all the apples and leaves off the tree and put on fake leaves and fake plums for a shot that got less than 5 seconds of screen time.  You can only imagine the outcry of true fans who would remember that they were supposed to be plum trees but saw apples on the trees in that little segment instead!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example; in the picture of me at Bag End, the tree above me is actually fake!  It was a beautiful old oak tree in the Lord of the Rings, but since the Hobbit was supposed to be 65 years earlier than LotR Jackson made the crew chop it down and replace it with a fake younger tree!  Even worse, the company in charge of making the fake leaves did a bad job on the leaves and they had faded by the time filming was supposed to start.  So, Jackson ordered someone to repaint all 200,000 leaves on the fake tree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/NZ/hobbit_barrow.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also learned a bit about film tricks for making people look bigger and smaller.  Some of the hobbit holes were made quite small so that when an adult human stood beside the door they looked very large.  Others were built at full size so that the door would look fine when a hobbit was standing next to it.  In other cases parts of the set were created special to create a perspective effect.  For example the wagon that Gandalf and Frodo are riding in the wagon together the wagon was constructed to be 3 meters long.  Gandalf rode in the front so that he looked very big while Frodo sat in the very back so that when filmed he looked very small, and like he was sitting next to Gandalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Green Dragon" src="../images/NZ/green_dragon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the tour we stopped at the Green Dragon for Ale!  I don't think this was where the scenes were filmed as every other structure here was created for filming from the outside in, or with just enough room for the camera crew to film from the inside out.  All indoor scenes were filmed in the studio, but this is part of the process of making Hobbiton more interesting for visitors.  We had a couple of choices of Ale, a cider, or a Ginger Beer.  This was also a great place to get some pictures of the Green Dragon along with the Mill and the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour really makes you appreciate camera angles!  On the bus back to the gift shop we saw some video clips from the movie and its amazing how large everything looks compared to how it seems in person.  I can't wait to get home and watch the extended edition disks that Josh bought me for Christmas.  Maybe with a few days off we will find time to watch them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was also our last day in New Zealand and marks the beginning of the journey home.  Tomorrow morning we fly to Fiji!  The Novotel airport is just 25 yards from the entrance to the international terminal, so one good thing is that we don't even need a cab to get to the airport in plenty of time for our flight!   I'm looking forward to a couple days of R&amp;amp;R on the water!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="NewZealand"></category></entry><entry><title>A Day at the Spa... or 45 minutes of Smelling Bad Gas</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-day-at-the-spa...-or-45-minutes-of-smelling-like-bad-gas.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-20T16:29:28-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-20T16:29:28-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2017-01-20:/PelicanBlog/a-day-at-the-spa...-or-45-minutes-of-smelling-like-bad-gas.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hot Springs" src="../images/NZ/spa1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up several times during the night, and each time I did I could hear the rain battering the metal roof of our condo.  Around 5:30 Jane woke up enough to say, "I don't want to go mountain biking on muddy trails." Then she rolled over and went back to sleep.  I figured she was probably right, even if the sun did come out this morning riding 20 miles on mud would not be a good first go at Mountain Biking.  Especially knowing that at the end of the ride we had to get in the car and drive to Rotorua.  After 3 plus weeks on the road we have lost our will to stop at any more charming roadside waterfalls, so todays trip was just a drive through the countryside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we lazed around the condo and made a leisurely drive up the east side of Lake Taupo.  We walked around the shopping area and had an early lunch at the Master of India restaurant in Taupo.  It was quite good, I had the Vindaloo and Jane had Korma, we split an order of Naan and Basmati and some Ginger Beer.  I'm going to have to talk to someone at Fareway about stocking Ginger Beer! After lunch we made our way North for another hour to Rotorua.  We had nothing special planned here as this was mostly meant as a stopover night (in close proximity to Hobbiton) on the way to Auckland.  However the Novotel here by the lake is quite nice, it is right next to Eat Street and we have a view of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane has been wanting to stop at a volcanic hot spring spa for a few days now, and I have been resisting.  But the brochure for the Polynesian Spa looked pretty nice and they had either a private option or an adult only group of pools.  So, I gave in.  I'm 75% done with Jack Reacher #13 so I could easily have stayed in the room and finished that book.  But that seemed silly.  We decided to go for the adult option because that gave us a choice of 8 different pools and there was no time limit.  We would have to wait for the private pool and then we were limited to 30 minutes.  Anyway, communal bathing is certainly illustrative of many interesting cultural differences.  The pools are constantly fed by natural hot spring water from right under the pools.  There are two types of hot springs here:  One that is good for your joints, and one that tarnishes the gold of your class ring. -- Yes there are warning signs, and &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; took note and left my ring in my backpack.  Jane now has a black 6 in her Luther ring.  Hopefully it can be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only addition would be to say that the Sulfur and other assorted gasses were rather pungent.  You may have guessed that already.   As a reward for being-a-good-guy-and-going-to-the-spa-with-my-wife, the hotel left a complimentary bottle of  Volcanic Hills Chardonnay by our bed.  Its now two minutes past happy hour so I will post this, and see what we think.  Its from the Hawkes Bay region and so far those have all been good.  New Zealand is really good with their Chardonnays and their Pinot Noirs.  No wonder I like this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we have a booking for dinner at a nice Italian place right on Eat Street called Leonardo's Pure Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

But we didn't get to see that version (thankfully!), I'll just have to watch the Lord of the Rings again to see that one.    We also didn't get to see this version &lt;img src="../images/NZ/ngauruhoe.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px;"&gt;.  It seems that the weather on the North island has been a bit unsettled.  Instead we saw this &lt;img src="../images/NZ/foggy_doom.jpg" style="width: 240px; float: left; margin: 5px;"&gt;. Mount Doom (Mt. Ngauruhoe) might be back there somewhere behind all the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of hiking the Tongariro Alpine trail for seven hours we took the "easy way out" an hiked the 2 hour trail to Taranaki Falls.  When we started out it was mostly just cloudy and misty.  But just after the falls it got bad, really bad.  The rain was coming sideways and even my mantra about good gear was not enough to overcome the chilling discomfort seeping through my pants and filling my shoes.  The falls were nice but we have seen lots of falls like these in New Zealand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video autoplay loop&gt;
&lt;source src="../images/NZ/rainy_wf.mp4" type="video/mp4" /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything this walk was to get us out of the hotel and doing something for a portion of our day.   We can't just hang out in our room all day.  Although we have a really nice 2-bedroom apartment that we could enjoy.  We had hoped that the forecast was wrong that that once we got to the visitor center there would be plenty of trails to hike and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we have a washer and a dryer, so after today we will have enough clean clothes to make it all the way back home without washing again!  Our shoes are going to require a bit of work to get dry.  We learned a good trick on the Routeburn:  stuff your shoes with newspaper to help them dry overnight.  Our room is pretty short on newspaper though so we'll see what happens.  The dryer is pretty hot so I'm not very enthusiastic about putting them in the dryer and letting them tumble around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Soaked" src="../images/NZ/soaked.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I think we might have gotten our day backwards!  I'm looking out the window and at 2:00 in the afternoon the rain has stopped and we are seeing some blue sky.  This is not out of line with the forecast this morning which showed a higher chance of blue sky &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; rain for this afternoon!  There is a winery a few miles away...

&lt;p&gt;When Jane told me that if the weather was right we might be able to sail our kayaks I was perplexed.  "How do you add a mast to a Kayak?"  I thought to myself.  So I had mostly put it out of my mind as an option until we were an hour into the first of two two-hour paddles today.  But then "Captain Jack" told us to make a raft and he started talking about how we would sail the kayaks.  The sail consisted of a big black square of fabric with big loops at each corner. We had four Kayaks so the women (Jane and Dani) sitting in the front of the two outside kayaks were instructed to put the loops around their wrists and hold on.  The
men in the two outside back Kayaks (Brad and Michael) were instructed to put the loops around one end of their paddles.  When we put the paddles in our laps and hoisted the sail we were off!  Sadly Kayaking and photography do not go together very well so this is the best picture we have of our sailing adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sailing!" src="../images/NZ/sailing.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayaking made us both feel pretty old.  about 5 minutes into the second 2 hour leg my arms started to cramp up.  I've been having a little tennis elbow in my left arm lately and that really started to hurt for a bit, luckily after the initial flare up it worked its way out and I was able to paddle.   After 30 minutes both of Jane's hands started to cramp, fingers pointing in all kinds of unnatural directions that needed to be moved back in place manually.  She wasn't able to paddle for more than a few seconds at a time from then on except for a few key places where we really needed both of us to paddle hard.  Incoming waves, outgoing tide, and a river flowing out make for some FUN kayaking conditions along the coast.  I really wish we could have captured them on camera,  but those moments will have to live on in our memories only!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we finished our afternoon of Kayaking we were both done!  Our final day gave us the option of hiking or kayaking and it didn't take any deliberation for us to realize that we had reached our limit.  six more hours of Kayaking was definitely not in our future.  Looking back, we made the right decision, and we enjoyed our final day of hiking very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estuary:  the tidal mouth of a river where the river meets the tide.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final leg of our hike today ended with an estuary crossing.  We arrived about an hour before low tide so our guide, Jack, suggested that we just chill a bit and wait for the tide to go down before we started our crossing.  So we walked around and counted the tiny little crabs and found some shrimp in a little stream.  then we watched some of the other hikers standing in water up to their knees waiting doubtfully for the tide to ebb.  At last Jack announced we would head out at 5:00, don't worry he said it won't be any higher than mid-thigh.  OK, Jack was a bit shorter than me so I wasn't worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider darker blue areas will be shallower he said, so aim for those if you are in doubt.   At 5 to 5 Jane and I started walking.  When we got to our knees we encountered the other hikers, still standing and waiting.  I pressed and found a path that came just above my knees.  "This way," I said and just like that I'm a leader.  A bit further on the water got deeper and Jane was nearly to her waist.  I was definitely above mid thigh, and feeling the current of the tide heading out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was as deep as it got and so we made it to the other side of the estuary feeling like this was our adventure for the day.  It was a beautiful 7km walk and totally different than the Routeburn.  With the ocean on one side of you at all times and regular boat service to lots of beaches all day long you feel much closer to the "real world" than you do on the Routeburn.  The scenery is also quite different with views of the bay rather than inland lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="golden bay" src="../images/NZ/golden_bay.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like our Routeburn adventure, the day ended at a lodge that has been part of the Wilson family's land since the 1800's, well before this land became a national park.  We had a delicious meal of lamb and mash and salad, and had a good time getting to know the other 8 hikers on our 3 day trip.  We had already met Teresa and Jerad from Melbourne on the bus.   There was also a couple from Northern Ireland (Michael and Dani) on their honeymoon and a family from Adelaide (Ronnie, Jeff, Craig and Lisa).  All were very nice, and once again we had several educators plus some Geologists in the group.  Once again it was a very fine group to share an adventure with and we hope our paths may cross again some day.&lt;/p&gt;

New Zealand drives on the left and there are many helpful arrows painted on the road to remind the foreign drivers of that fact.  As always, Jane took the drivers seat and I rode shotgun in on the passenger side.  We left Queenstown after a nice breakfast at the hotel and headed toward the west coast.  Our destination for the first night was Franz Josef.  A small little town near the Franz Josef glacier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of observations about driving in New Zealand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One lane bridges are everywhere!  We counted twenty seven one lane bridges on our 280km journey the first day.  I think this is part of the great environmental movement in New Zealand that they think really carefully before messing with anything in nature.  Sure it slows you down a bit and occasionally you need to wait for a couple of cars to cross before you can take your turn but maybe a reminder to slow down is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have these nice bullseye signs that say 100 its not a target, drive according to conditions.  its pretty hard to drive 100km/hr anyway as the roads are very twisty.  I would guess we averaged closer to 60km/hr. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell phone coverage outside the cities is pretty much non-existent.  I'm pretty sure this is again related to the environmental focus of the country.  Don't mess up the countryside by installing thousands of cell towers.  This also impacts things like Google maps where the travel time estimates are wildly wrong.  If they don't get any feedback on the actual speed people drive the only thing they can rely on is the posted speed limits, which are way higher than almost anyone drives!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped in the grocery store on the way out of Queenstown to pick up some meat and cheese, bread, and Ginger Beer,   so we could do a simple lunch somewhere along the way.   Once we reached the west coast, we drove in rain most of the day, and nothing we could see in a two minute walk from the side of the road could compare to what we saw on the Routeburn Track. Our lodging that night was at a small boutique B&amp;amp;B (The Westwood Lodge).  It was super nice, just like the host who gave us a nice recommendation to go to Alice May for dinner.  We did and we had a nice meal: Fish and Chips for Jane and I had a stuffed chicken breast with Brie cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning dawned sunny and clear, so we felt really great about our decision to postpone our visit to the glacier until the morning.  On the way to the glacier it started to sprinkle a bit again, but by the time we had hiked closer to the glacier we were rewarded with nice sunny weather again!  We were also lucky that we didn't try to go the day before because one of the wooden bridges across one of the many creeks had been washed out in a downpour the previous day.  &lt;img alt="Bridge Out" src="../images/NZ/washout.jpg"&gt; we picked our way across the stone in the now-very-tame creek and continued to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Franz Josef" src="../images/NZ/franz_josef.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back we noticed a couple of construction workers with their massive power tools standing around watching each other prepare to work.  We assumed that they were going to excavate and rebuild the bridge.  A project likely to take weeks at their pace.  Yes, construction seems to move at the same speed everywhere in the world.  But as we walked further we met up with a dozen cheerful  red-shirted volunteers carrying shovels and pickaxes.  They were headed to fix the bridge too.  I recon they took care of it by lunch time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our glacier hike we continued our way north.  We didn't have far to go and todays destination was a small B&amp;amp;B called Breakers, just north of Greymouth. We were met by the owner, Jan, who was a very delightful person to chat with.  She was amazed at how light we were traveling and suggested we may want to give lessons to some of her previous guests.  We arrived in mid-afternoon, with nothing else on the agenda except for lounging around and enjoying the view of the Tasman sea.  Huge wave after wave coming in from the west was mesmerizing.  We didn't even leave the B&amp;amp;B for dinner that night as Jan made us a nice homemade pizza to enjoy in the comfort of our room or on the nice back porch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tasman View" src="../images/NZ/tasman.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final day of driving was the longest, but we made some fun stops along the way to break up the driving.  The first was at Pancake Rock.  Once again great views of the Tasman Sea, Blowholes in the rocks and just really interesting rock formations to gawk at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pancake Rock" src="../images/NZ/pancake_rock.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stop was a tourist trap, but we stopped willingly to wander across the southern hemisphere's longest swinging bridge.  Spanning the Buller Gorge it was a nice view, but not nearly so much fun to have to pass someone on the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Swinging Bridge" src="../images/NZ/buller_bridge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got closer to Nelson and realized we had plenty of time to spare before the rental car drop-off closed we decided to head into wine country and visit a couple of wineries in the hills Northwest of Nelson.  We made a stop at Kaharunga and Neudorf wineries.  This region is known for some pretty nice Chardonnays and rightly so.  We need to figure out how to get some Neudorf delivered to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

We had sort of concluded that if the helicopter return was not going to go, and we could back out at this late time, we would cancel and just enjoy a day of leisure in Queenstown.  The Helicopter was not confirmed, we were the only two booked, and they need at least four people booked to fly.  But we couldn't cancel either. -- Real Journeys take note, this is a terrible and unfair policy!  To charge someone full fare to cancel a flight that is not even confirmed is ridiculous.  With the NSF grant deadline about 36 hours away I was ready to cancel anyway and stay in the room to finish up my work on the grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning came and it was sunny and nice in Queenstown, so I did a bit of grant work and decided I would take my iPad on the bus.  After all, I had already seen the first four hours of the trip on our journey to the Routeburn Track!  The first bit of luck for the day was that the bus had WiFi!  At least until just after Te Anau.  So, I had about three hours of time to work on the grant and upload things to the NSF website.  By the time we got to Te Anau I was feeling really good and I had all of the stuff for Luther uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next bit of good news was that our driver seemed pretty confident that even though the clouds were really low and the fixed wing planes were on hold, the helicopters would still fly.  But we still would not know whether we had another four hour bus ride at the end of the boat tour of the sound or whether we would have a nice 45 minute helicopter tour back to Queenstown at the end of the boat ride.  We would just have to wait to know for sure.  But again, Barry the bus driver was optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two hour boat tour of Milford Sound was really great.  The boat moved along slowly just a few meters from the sheer mountainside.  The walls of the mountain come straight out of the water and soar 5-6 thousand meters over us.  You really can't grasp the scale of it unless you see another boat or some people to give you an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Milford Scale" src="../images/NZ/milford_scale.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we made it to the Tasman sea at the end of the sound and looked back we marveled that anyone would ever think to try to bring a ship there!  You can't tell from the oceanside that there is this narrow sound leading back to a nice little spot to land and build a small town.  Nevertheless Captain Thomas Cook did follow the sound back and mapped out the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the boat trip was definitely the final waterfall.  The captain took our boat right up to the base of the fall, and we looked straight up at water falling some 52 stories!  The height of the IDS tower in Minneapolis, nothing but water falling straight down at you.  It is really beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Milford Scale" src="../images/NZ/milford_scale1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived back at Milford the captain announced that we had made it just in time as the weather was about to "turn to custard." Whatever that meant we were not sure but we were pretty sure that helicopters are not meant to fly in custard.  So we walked back to bus 17 steeling ourselves for another four hours on the coach.  Fortunately when we arrived at the bus we were met with a big thumbs up from Barry!  At least one other couple had upgraded to confirm our helicopter tour back to Queenstown!  Now we just had to get out of Milford before the custard formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rode the shuttle to the airport with another couple from our bus and hopped off just in time to see one helicopter take off and another, the color we were looking for, come in for a landing.  However... as the pilot got out of our copter and started toward us, a bus pulled up and dropped off another couple.  the pilot looked at all of our tickets and got a very perplexed look on his face.  the two people he had brought in were booked to go right back, and now there were a total of eight of us for a six passenger ride.  After some time, and a lot of anxious looking at the clouds turning to custard it was finally determined that the previous pilot had left prematurely.  He would turn around and come back for the final couple to arrive.  The rest of us would be on our way.  After a very short safety briefing we boarded and took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane was on one side of the helicopter and I was on the other.  She was on the side closest to the mountain.  As I kept looking at her side I kept thinking how glad I was on my side.  Her side seemed to be just feet from the side of the sheer mountain!  One gust of wind and we are goners I thought.  But, no worries, these Kiwi Alpine pilots know their stuff.  The ride turned out to be (mostly) smooth and really really beautiful.  what a treat to fly over some of the mountains we had hiked through in the beautiful sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alpine Lake" src="../images/NZ/alpine_lake.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our adventures were not over because the flight home included a short stop on a glacier!  Well, more of a big snowbank than a glacier, and really I didn't think there was any way we could land in the spot we landed.  It didn't look level and the pilot landed just feet from the edge.  Did I mention these Alpine pilots are really really good?  so we got out and tramped about in the snow for a few minutes, Jane in nothing but sandals!  Pictures were taken and we were all in awe of the beauty.  But very soon we piled back in the helicopter and took off for the last bit of our journey to Queenstown.  We were back by 5:10, a full three hours before the coach was supposed to be back, plus we had an amazing helicopter adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New Zealand Falls" src="../images/NZ/green_falls.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Queenstown just in time to appreciate the change in temperature. We left the 90 degree weather in Melbourne and arrived to 70 degree weather in Queenstown.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New Zealand Falls" src="../images/NZ/green_falls.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Queenstown just in time to appreciate the change in temperature. We left the 90 degree weather in Melbourne and arrived to 70 degree weather in Queenstown.  It was a very welcome change in both temperature and scenery.  It takes about 30 seconds to realize why Peter Jackson decided to film Lord of the Rings here!  The steep Mountains and misty low clouds around Lake Wakatipu  make you want to break out into some  dwarf songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had just enough time to check into the St. Moritz before a short walk down the hill to the Ultimate Hikes center for our pre-hike briefing.  Now is a good time to note that Jane and I have. noticed that we are no longer the young couple on the tours we have chosen.  Most of the people we have met and toured with so far on this trip have been 20 years younger than us.  Life Happens!  As we contemplated 3 days of hiking with 30 year olds we were getting a bit nervous.  So, we were pretty relieved to see that the vast majority of the 27 people at our briefing were in our age bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no bad weather, only bad gear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I didn't take anything else away from the briefing it was this quote.  And we were really glad that we had done our homework and invested in some good rain gear and merino wool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day of the trek kicked by meeting our guides -- Jono, Anthony, Sadao, and Jo -- then a bus ride leaving Queenstown at 6:30AM.  We had a two hour bus ride until our stop morning tea in Te Anau.  Every tour in Australia and New Zealand includes a stop for morning tea and scones.  Very civilized.  We had a couple more hours on the bus after morning tea before we got to the start of the trek in the Fiordland National Park.  This first day we had around four hours of trekking (7.5 miles) to get to our first night's lodging at Lake Mackenzie. The first hour and a half was all up hill pretty steadily, so even though we were geared up for the 50 degree weather and rain we began shedding layers only a few minutes into the hike.  With four guides, one was at the front, one at the back and two floated between people in the middle.  It didn't take long for us to stretch out with the back being about an hour behind the front.  We were somewhere near the middle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We carried our lunches in with us, and we carried the rubbish out.  The National Parks in New Zealand have no rubbish bins to prevent animals from learning to scavenge food.  It works well.  I don't think we saw one bit of litter anywhere along the track.  We hiked uphill to Howden Hut where we had our lunch stop along with hot tea and coffee made by our guides.  We walked out of the rain shortly after lunch and enjoyed a really scenic hike through the afternoon.  The highlight of the afternoon was definitely the Earland Falls.  Anthony said, make sure you have your inhalers, it will take your breath away.  And he was right.  As with many of the sites on our trip pictures don't do justice to the actual scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Earland Falls" src="../images/NZ/earland_falls.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived MacKenzie hut around 4:00 and we were definitely ready to stop for the day.  We were met at the entrance by Chris who had hot chocolate (called Milo here down under) and snacks for us.  He gave us a quick tour of the lodge and showed us to our room.   We were  blown away by the accomodations.  Ultimate Hikes made some kind deal with the Department of Conservation (DOC) whereby they built new facilities for the park in exchange for getting the concession for guided hikes and the ability to build their own huts on the track.  They were so clean and nice.  We had our own room with ensuite and shower.  There was a clothes washing area, and a huge warm room called the drying room.  Then a really nice common area where we could hang out, have a drink, eat our meals and get to know the rest of our group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner tonight we had entrees of Hummus or Salmon spread with cheese and meat.  For our main we had  our choice between a New Zealand Rib Eye and Chicken.  For desert we had brownies and ice cream.   Yes we were "roughing it" all right.  It took us a few meals to understand that in Australia and New Zealand they call appetizers "entrees" and the entree is called the "main."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mackenzie_lodge" src="../images/NZ/mackenzie_lodge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the first night we also got to watch a helicopter landing.  One of our group had fallen on the track and broken her wrist and hurt her leg pretty badly. So, she and her husband were evacuated by helicopter.  The rescue team landed on a tiny little pad right next to the hut.  Clearly these guys know what they are doing to drop out of the clouds and land right on target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 10:00 the generators are shut off until 7:30 the next morning.  But that really wasn't a problem as we were all in bed by 9:30 that first night!  I was talking to one of the guides about their arrangement with the DOC and he said that the generator times, along with every detail down to the dishwashing soap and toilet paper was negotiated to have minimal environmental impact on the National Park.   Everything at the hut is flown in and out by helicopter once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day Two&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mackenzie Lake" src="../images/NZ/lake_mackenzie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day two began with sandwich making at 7:45.  Amazingly we slept solid until 7:00 when I needed to get up and use the ensuite.   A few experimental steps revealed that all the limbs were still working as they should with amazingly little stiffness.  Continental breakfast was at 8:15 followed by eggs Benedict at 8:30.  At 9:15 we met for a group photo by Lake Mackenzie and then we were off for a good six hours of walking.   The beginning was again steadily up hill, then we rounded the mountain onto the rainy and windy side! The distance for today was just 6.9 miles but it was slower going than yesterday! There is no bad weather, only bad gear I repeated to myself.  Nevertheless we made it to the hut on Harris Saddle for our rest/lunch stop.  After lunch I did the optional climb up Conical Hill while Jane continued on towards the Routeburn Lodge with a few others.  After the Harris Saddle and the Conical Hill the rest of the day was down hill  which was nice but pretty hard on my calfs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Conical Hill" src="../images/NZ/harris_lake.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple times today we were rewarded with a glimpse of what a great view we could have on one of the rare clear days.  Still it was all beautiful in a Lord of the Rings kind of way.  Although I walked by myself most of the afternoon, I enjoyed just going my own pace and enjoying the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second night we stayed at Routeburn lodge.  By the way if you've been reading Routeburn as "rowt burn" you are doing it wrong, it is "root burn." This lodge is very similar to the Lake Mackenzie lodge but with a great view of the valley and the Routeburn falls right behind.  We were all bit more tired and a lot more wet than we were the day before.  So dinner was served a bit earlier.  Tonights fare included a delicious Pesto soup as the entree followed by a choice of Salmon or New Zealand lamb chops.  By now we had gotten to know a lot of our fellow trekkers pretty well, so before dinner and during dinner conversation was very lively.  We have met a surprising number of people from Chicago on this trip and we have really enjoyed getting to know them, especially Dave and Lynn Reiner.  We also met lots of nice people from New Zealand including a couple women (Jennifer and Megan) who reminded me of Jane and Shirley if they had New Zealand accents and were to take off on their own adventure.  Lots of the people in the group were involved in education including the two women I mentioned and  Professor Tiano from Duke University in Singapore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice to be surrounded by other academics as I was beginning to stress about the impending NSF grant deadline back home.  Leaving my co-authors to finish the proposal while I was totally off the grid for 3 days is not the best plan. Of course agreeing to do the grant in the first place when you know the deadline is in the middle of your holiday does not show the best judgement either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at about 4AM on day three, once again needing to use the ensuite.  However my first couple of steps out of bed were so painful I spent the next couple hours in and out of sleep wondering if my muscles would loosen enough for me to walk down the track on my own power.  Thankfully day three dawned bright and sunny for the final 5.7 miles of our trek.  Once again we started our day with sandwich making followed by continental breakfast and then eggs and bacon.  Sadly it took me until day three to get lesson in making a proper cup of Milo from Jono.  To anyone who may happen upon this in preparation for a trip to New Zealand here is the procedure:  pour a couple tablespoons of cream into your coffee cup, then add six, yes six, spoonfuls of milo and mix it into a paste with the cream.  You may have to add more to get the right pasty consistency.  Then after you have a good chocolatey paste you can add the hot water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Routeburn Flats" src="../images/NZ/routeburn_flats.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's walk was the easiest of the three with the route being mostly down hill to the Routeburn flats and then more gentle downhill  for the 5.7 mile distance to the end of the route.  We had several intermediate stops along the way including an early lunch along the river.  By the end of the trek we felt like we had really experienced New Zealand at its best.  Great people, great scenery, no crowds, just lots of great natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="River" src="../images/NZ/final_lunch.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final stop of the trek was at the pub in Glenorchy for a schooner of ale and the presentation of our certificates of achievement!  Several suggested that this certificate of achievement would make a good addition to my bio for the grant proposal 😜&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="NewZealand"></category><category term="Hiking"></category></entry><entry><title>The Great Ocean Road</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-great-coastal-road.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-06T20:59:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-06T20:59:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2017-01-06:/PelicanBlog/the-great-coastal-road.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Great Ocean Road" src="../images/NZ/gor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Arrival and Trolly Tour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Melbourne and took a little dinner tour of the city on a dinner trolly.  We thought it would be mediocre food, but a good way to see the city.  It turned out that the food was better than expected, and in the end we didn't see too much of Melbourne.  Still fun, and we got to see "The Original Taco Bills". Those of you who were at Luther in the 80's will appreciate the Taco Bills excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dinner Trolly" src="../images/Australia/trolly.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Taco Bill" src="../images/NZ/taco_bill.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Great Ocean Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great ocean road was built along the southern coast of Australia in the 30's by men in the ANZAC (Australia New Zealand Army Corps). These were primarily WWI soldiers who needed work, and time to recover from the war.  The statue at the beginning of the road commemorates these men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="parrots" src="../images/Australia/parrots.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from our morning tea, and a lunch stop we made three main stops today:  One for a Koala and Parrot viewing, the second for a 30 minute hike in the rain forest and the third at the 12 Apostles.  Although the crowds were as thick as the flies the 12 Apostles were really the highlight of the day.  Fun fact:  The Australian government originally called these "the apostles" since there were only nine of them, but the tourists kept referring to them as the 12 apostles so eventually some marketing person in the government gave in and they renamed the site to the 12 Apostles and it remains that to this day.  The name is increasingly less accurate at the moment as one of the  9 came down a few years back.   However, in a few thousand years it is likely that the numbers will increase again as erosion along the shore does its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOW!  we haveve just finished a day on a live aboard dive boat where we did 4 dives and 2 snorkels on the great barrier reef.  I saw Nemo, Dory and all the rest, except for Crush!  Plus we saw sea slugs, octopus, sharks (not Bruce!!) lobster, and many many more.  My ear is a bit plugged up from the four dives, but its worth a few days of having the world sound a little muffled.  I haven't even mentioned that one of the dives was a night dive!  We stood on the ship and looked at the reef sharks swimming next to the ship and still jumped in with our "torches."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night diving is definitely a bit eerie and I'll admit I was a bit nervous about that one.  It was quite the sensation to be underwater-weightless and in complete darkness except for the light from your own flashlight. We saw a lot of fish that we did not see during the day and of course we saw a bunch of sharks.  Not the man-eating kind, just the normal kind that are more afraid of us than we are of them.  The most common fish we saw on the night dive was the Giant Trevally.   They were not afraid of our lights, and in fact  knew just how to take advantage of them.  If you held your light on a smaller fish for too long one of these big Trevallys would swoop in and ... there would no longer be a smaller fish there.  Unfortunately we did not get any pictures during the night dive, but the next morning we did a 6:30AM dive and were rewarded with a glassy sea and crystal clear water for viewing lots of active fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Angel" src="../images/Australia/angel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat we were on was called Reef Encounter and was by far the best diving experience ever!  The crew was really knowledgeable and really helpful with novice and rusty divers alike.  Our guide for the whole trip was Hugo and and he was fantastic.  He was very patient with reminding us of all the details of setting up our gear, and let me descend as slowly as I needed to in order to keep my ears from exploding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reef" src="../images/Australia/reef_fish1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live aboard boat is really the way to do the great barrier reef as you don't spend three hours of your day getting out and back from the reef.  Rather you can spend most of the first day diving, and again the second day you can start first thing in the morning.  We transferred to the boat from shore on a day excursion boat that tied up with our ship to let us off and then pick us up again the next day.   We had great company while onboard and because we were a part of the "Top Deck" program we ate our meals on the top deck with just a few other people that we enjoyed getting to know.  In addition since things are very informal and everyone is on there to snorkel or dive we only brought our day packs with swimming suits, toiletries and an extra t-shirt.  They don't allow any shoes on board so there was no worrying about extra shoes to wear to dinner either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we returned to Cairns it was pouring rain and our guy Hugo offered to escort us off the boat with his umbrella.  Sadly it was not an umbrella built for 3 and the wind was blowing so hard that the rain was mostly horizontal anyway, so even the nicest umbrella in the world would not have helped too much.  The reception at the Shangri La was super nice when we arrived and immediately gave us towels to dry off with while they checked us in and retrieved the luggage we had stored there while we were on the live aboard. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Australia"></category><category term="Diving"></category></entry><entry><title>Hiking the Valley of the Winds</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/hiking-the-valley-of-the-winds.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-05T10:40:47-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-05T10:40:47-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2017-01-05:/PelicanBlog/hiking-the-valley-of-the-winds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Uluru" src="../images/Australia/uluru.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we flew three hours and 1.5 timezones out of our way to see a big red rock!  I'm not sure where to start unpacking this, the 1.5 timezones or the big red rock.  But if you do a bit of research on Australia and the aboriginal people you will quickly learn about Uluru, or Ayer's Rock.   If you are on the right side of the plane you will get a nice view of this huge rock rising up in the middle of hundreds of miles of flatness.  The picture above was taken at our outdoor dinner experience called "The Sounds of Silence."  There were about 60 of us out on a sand dune in the desert with a great view of Uluru and its sister called Kata-Tjuta.  We were seated at a table with a family from Melbourne and a family from the US.  The one son that I sat next to worked at Google as a software engineer, needless to say we had some good conversation that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan had been to rent some bikes and ride around Uluru, but unfortunately last week they had massive rainstorms that washed out many of the trails, so they were closed except for one very short walking trail.  We visited the head of that trail on the afternoon we arrived but didn't go very far as the temperatures were over 100 degrees, and no shade in sight!  We changed our plan to drive a short distance and hike the Valley of the Winds at Kata-Tjuta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First View Point" src="../images/Australia/kata_tjuta1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got up and out the door by 6AM to make sure that we could hike in the coolest part of the day.  They actually will close the hiking trails around 11AM if the temp is forecast to be over 37 Celsius! The hike to this first view point was easy and and a good way to warm up our hiking trail legs.  However when we arrived at the first viewpoint the sign told us that the rest of the trail was closed!  We, and the four other people  that were a few minutes behind us assumed that this was simply a left over from yesterday and they hadn't changed the sign yet that morning.  So, we ignored the sign and pressed on for the Karingana lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First View Point" src="../images/Australia/kata_tjuta1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a reward for an excellent little hike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Ayer's Rock is definitely a bit out of the way it was definitely worth the time and effort to see it.  It is considered a sacred place to the Anangu people.  Maybe it was the remoteness of the place or the lack of crowds, but you could definitely get a sense that it was a special place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Australia"></category></entry><entry><title>Happy New year!</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/fireworks-with-russel-crowe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-31T18:17:33-06:00</published><updated>2016-12-31T18:17:33-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-12-31:/PelicanBlog/fireworks-with-russel-crowe.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the new year in Australia is definitely something special.  Everywhere we went the air in the city smelled like barbecue, and people were queueing to get into the free parks all afternoon.  There is definitely a lot of pride by the people of Sydney in their preparations for the big show.  We spent a good part of the morning hiking around Bondi beach and the surrounding area.  Then we just chilled at the flat for most of the afternoon, watching the families queuing to get the best position to view the fireworks.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they opened the gates to the park right below our flat at 6:00 it had the feel of a giant family picnic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great way to get over jet lag is to just get up in the morning and get going again.  Although we only made it until 8:30 last night we did manage to sleep until about 4 AM.  Our Blue Mountain tour started at 6:30 AM so we were wide awake and ready to go with no trouble.  We had a great guide for a day long tour out into the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney.  After a 90 minute drive from Sydney we stopped for Tea and Scones before our visit to Echo point to see the three sisters Meehni, Wimlah and Gunnedoo.  Legend has it that their father turned them to stone rather than let them marry three brothers from a rival tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Three Sisters" src="../images/Australia/three_sisters.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboriginal legends in Australia are just as believable as the native american legends in the USA.  However if you look closely at the picture you'll notice there are actually four pillars of stone, the smallest one is their little brother Dave.  Made famous a few years back when the locals started a social media campaign to #RememberDave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great hiking trails in the area, including one which will bring you right over to the three sisters.  We were on an easier tour instead of a several mile hike we got in line at Scenic World and rode the gondola across.  This gave us a great, if fleeting, view of some waterfalls.  From there we took another gondola on a steep descent into the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/Australia/scenic_world.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are in the rainforest they have three options:  a 10, 20 or 30 minute walk through the forest on a nice safe boardwalk.  At the end you can ride up the train (the steepest in the world) to the top.  All in all it was very scenic and a nice walk but I think we would have preferred to skip the lines for the 'rides' and just walk the trails on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a very nice lunch of fish and chips we made our way to  Featherdale to have our picture taken with a Koala and to feed the Kangaroos.  Before we arrived I was calling it the 'petting zoo', but in the end it turned out alright. Coming face to face with a real Kangaroo is definitely cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Koala" src="../images/Australia/koala.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition Featherdale had lots of really interesting native animals including a Tasmanian Devil -- it doesn't look anything at all like the one from the bugs bunny cartoons.  But its jaw muscles are among the strongest in the animal kingdom.  We also saw a Cassowary - think a turkey crossed with a Velociraptor.  In fact they say it is a holdover from the dinosaurs.  They have a hard crown (called a casque) on top of their head which is probably used as a sound box or radar for picking up the low frequency calls these creatures make.   The Cassowary an endangered species but almost nobody has heard about them because they are not nearly as cute as the Koalas.  They can jump six feet in the air and sprint 30 mph! I would not want to be chased by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To round out the day we had a quick tour through Sydney's Olympic park.  Still a very vibrant area to this day.  And then a water taxi ride back to the Circle Quay in the heart of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Note 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture of me at the top of this post was taken on another little side trip to a place called Lincoln's Rock.  It just demonstrates the importance of perspective when you are framing a photo.  I can assure you that I was never in danger of anything more than a broken leg had I managed to somehow slip off that ledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Note 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is also an explanation for how/why the Blue Mountains got their name.  You can see there is kind of a blue haze in the background.  This is because the mountains are full of eucalyptus trees and there is enough eucalyptus oil that evaporates into the air that refraction causes the air to look a little bit bluer.  Australians also like to talk about how fresh and clear the air is in the blue mountains, in fact one enterprising Australian apparently even put blue mountain air into cans and sold it in China!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Australia"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello Nemo!</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/hello-nemo!.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-31T06:46:15-06:00</published><updated>2016-12-31T06:46:15-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-12-31:/PelicanBlog/hello-nemo!.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View of Bridge and Opera House" src="../images/Australia/airbnb_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sitting by the window of our flat in Pott's Point with the view you see in the picture above.  (Except its morning now).   We are starting to get past the jet lag that comes from being 15 hours ahead of home base with the help of a couple of event filled days that kept us moving and awake.  Today we are going to do something more relaxing in advance of the huge new years eve celebration tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flat that we rented has this spectacular view of the harbor and the city skyline.  But it lacks one key ingredient for the three days we happened to be here for.  Air Conditioning!  The weather in Sydney is very unseasonably warm.  When Jane did the research we learned that the average temp is in the high 70's this time of year, so AC didn't even cross the mind.  Unfortunately our first day here the temp was nearly 100 and yesterday was mid-90's.  So we come home at night to a very warm place to sleep.  Luckily even the heat can't keep us awake come 9-10:00 at night.  I slept pretty well through the night last night so I'm hopeful that midnight is an achievable goal.  I'm definitely looking forward to wishing everyone a Happy New year when it is only morning of New Years eve in your time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first day in Sydney we explored the Botanical Gardens and the area around the Opera House and the bridge.  It was miserably hot and we were way out of whack with jet lag, so even now, I'm not sure how clearly I'm remembering everything.  We had a nice lunch at a place right on Woolloomooloo bay - yes thats a real name.  Lots of things in Australia have the 'oo' in their names.  This is a combination of Aboriginal pronunciation and the teaching  of phonics (Not sure phonics was a thing in the early 1800's).  After our late lunch we walked to the Opera house, we were able to get into the lobby but no further as their was an afternoon performance going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Opera House" src="../images/Australia/opera_house.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we had planned to hike over to the bridge and go up one of the towers.  But we nearly cracked in the heat.   A short rest and some re-hydration gave us a second wind and so we continued to wander around, eventually making our way to the bridge.  We made our way to the top of the tower just 15 minutes before closing and were rewarded with some really spectacular views of the harbor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Harbor" src="../images/Australia/harbor_view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time it was after 5pm Sydney time and the middle of the night to our bodies.  Our feet were tired from walking so we gave in and grabbed a cab back to the flat.   We worked really really hard to stay awake until about 8:30.  But sleep took us, at least until about 3am!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Australia"></category></entry><entry><title>All the Christmas Presents are Early</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/packed-and-ready.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-19T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-12-19T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-12-19:/PelicanBlog/packed-and-ready.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We leave the house tomorrow morning and we won't be back until January 26th.

&lt;p&gt;So, all of our Christmas presents are things for the trip.  We didn't wrap them up and put them under the tree because we leave the 27th and we each got a new roll-aboard for the trip.  We had to test-pack and re-pack to make sure we could make it.  This is the new travelling ultra-light experiment and I have to say I am pretty excited about it.  Once you do a bit of reading and planning it turns out to be pretty easy to travel for four weeks with nothing but a light roll-aboard and a daypack.  Yes I'm a regular poster child for &lt;a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com"&gt;Osprey Packs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="All Packed" src="/images/January16/packed.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its funny that the most difficult decision for me was to decide on the tech that I am bringing.  I've gone back and forth between Macbook Pro (2016 13 inch edition) Plus iPad mini to 12.9 inch iPad pro plus Kindle Voyager.  Amazingly there is only 300 grams difference in weight between the iPad Pro and the new Macbook Pro.  However, I'm really excited about the experiment of writing daily blog posts with nothing but the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have the ideal setup (for a Geek like me) with &lt;a href="https://workingcopyapp.com"&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt; plus a dedicated server for my blog and Jenkins which will detect and automatically rebuild every time I commit a new post!  I'll be Syncing photos from my Sony 𝛂6000 to my iPad and then writing posts with iA Writer.  when Working Copy pushes them to my github repository, Jenkins swings into action and runs Pelican to rebuild the static website that is my Blog.  (I know because I'm practicing on this post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very excited for this trip and feeling no guilt because Josh is off on a JTerm adventure to Italy and Kaia is, well, married and on her own :-) (sorry Kaia)  I'll be posting about our adventures here regularly, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Wrapping up the RV Adventure</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/wrapping-up-the-rv-adventure.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-30T08:30:19-05:00</published><updated>2016-06-30T08:30:19-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-06-30:/PelicanBlog/wrapping-up-the-rv-adventure.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Canada/peyto_lake_selfie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are on I-94 heading across North Dakota today, the amount of road construction almost makes us long for Hwy 2 in Montana.  Our anticipated day of uninterrupted four lane travel has been marred numerous times already by lane closures that stretch on for 12 miles apiece.  We are hoping to make it all the way to Minneapolis today and turn in the RV about 12 hours early.  If the going is too slow we can spend one more night on the road and bring it in tomorrow morning, but I think we are all settled in for the final push.  Its been a great trip, better than any of us anticipated.  We all agreed that there is a lot of appeal to traveling by RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other night around the campfire we were reminiscing about our anniversary adventures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 year - a week in Door County, young new parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year - a cruise aboard a Carnival Funship!  Once on Carnival is enough, and an infamous catamaran trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 year - a Mediterranean cruise on Royal Caribbean, exhausting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 year - Cruising the Hawaiian islands on Norwegian, injuries galore, getting saved by a lifeguard, and losing bicycle breaks on the way down the mountain!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 year - Alaskan cruise on Princess plus an extended trip to Denali, whales and bears and moose!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 year - RV trip to Banff and Glacier, fun and very relaxed. (but scarce wildlife)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a quite a list of cool places to visit, and a lot of years of great friendship!  None of us had really though about how many cruises the list included, so it was definitely time for a land adventure.   Who knows where our next adventure will take us in five years.  If we all make it to our 50th anniversary what will  we do then?  We'll all be in our early 70's by then, so chances are slim that we'll make a return to mountain hiking.  But, who knows by the 70 will be the new 50.  Whatever the case may be we are lucky to have such great lifelong friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm finishing up this last post of the vacation just 160 miles from Minneapolis.  Today has been a wild day of quick stops for gas, Burger King takeout (our first fast food of the trip) and switching drivers at rest stops or an off ramp.  We are &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; out of the windy North Dakota, Northwest Minnesota winds, in fact we have a nice tail wind pushing along now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have said many times before travel always changes me, or gives me a new perspective.  My world of computer science is pretty clean and indoors.  It was great to get out and appreciate the natural world.  Its sad to see how the glaciers are receding and I hope we have the will to do something about climate change.  On the other hand it was very hopeful to see how people in both Canada and the United States treat the national parks.  You can tell that the people who visit have a certain reverence for the parks and what they represent.  They are clean and free of litter, people that you meet on the trails are generally smiling and greet you in a friendly way.

&lt;p&gt;We were just passed Ptarmigan Falls on our way back down when from behind me I heard, "Oh Crap!!" I thought Brian must have hurt himself so I asked "What's wrong?" He said "I just remembered I have the keys to the RV!" Uh Oh!  I thought, Jane and Holly are not going to be too happy when we get back.  We had started the hike together that morning going as far as Ptarmigan Falls.  At the falls we decided that the guys would continue on to Iceberg Lake, while the women returned to the campsite at their own leisurely pace.  Nobody thought about the one and only key to unlock Willard when we parted ways.  The rest of the hike we brainstormed ways that Jane and Holly would break in to the RV, we had visions of Jane boosting Holly through the front screen window, or failing that to recruit one of the small neighbor kids for that duty.  Alternatively we figured they were just over at the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn cooling off and using the free WiFi.  It turned out that they did use the WiFi, but we found them in good spirits lounging in the shade outside the RV waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the hike out to Iceberg Lake and back was a good 10.2 miles and our longest of the trip, it was definitely worth the effort.  Iceberg lake is part of a &lt;em&gt;cirque&lt;/em&gt;.  What is a cirque you ask? It is a half-open steep-sided hollow at the head of a valley or on a mountainside, formed by glacial erosion.  Think of a giant ice cream scoop digging out half a mountain and you get the idea.  The image doesn't really capture it, but gives you an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/Glacier/iceberg_lake_cirque.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip to Iceberg Lake was entertaining due mostly to two little boys hiking ahead of us.  Boundless energy and a total willingness to get wet at every opportunity.  At one point we caught up with them at a small stream where one of them was dunking his sweaty little head into the rushing water.  His father, of course, was egging him on and taking pictures of the thing.  Instant brain freeze was all we could think about.   A while later they caught up with us at Iceberg Lake, which really does have icebergs floating around.  One of them was just close enough to shore to be really really tempting for these two.  The shoes were off and they were hopping from rock to rock determined to get to the little iceberg and claim in for their kingdom.  The water was cold, REALLY COLD, so they were not willing to wade in above their ankles or for more than just a few seconds.  We left before they claimed the berg, but we were convinced it was just a matter of time before one of them got completely soaked!  We did catch this picture of a young brit who had brought his swimtrunks along on the hike for the purpose of getting in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Slow Down!" Ok, this was not delivered in the sing-songy spirit of the Simon and Garfunkel hit by the same name.  Despite the fact that I was only going 15 miles per hour, apparently it was uncomfortable to those in the back.  I'm not surprised as it was not a great, no, not even a good road.  It was a crappy road 12 miles long to get back to the Many Glacier campground.  A place that I had heard in my head the entire trip as the "Mini-Glacier Campground" was imagining something on the order of a snow cone.  Tonight was to be our first RV night "boondocking it" No electrical, no water, no sewer.  We switched into full conservation mode.  The worst thing was we were also in a no generator zone so we couldn't even make coffee in the morning.  It really wasn't that bad as we just walked over the the store with our travel mugs and got some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out yesterday with our rental car and headed back up to Logan's pass.  One day ago it was shrouded in clouds, fog, and rain.  But today the skies were sunny with just a few puffy clouds to make things interesting.  What a difference a day makes.  The sunshine gives Glacier a whole different look.  I can't even say better because despite the overcast weather of the day before it was still really cool.  But, once we got to Logan's pass we were set to make the hike to hidden lake.  A hike in the snow!!  Its June 26 and we are hiking in the snow!  Layers People!  We started with a lot of layers and ended up with short sleeves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was, by far, the nicest day of our trip so far, with clear skies and highs in the mid 70's!  We started out in shorts and short sleeves today.  The &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; was to make today an easy day, saving our energy for tomorrow's hike to Iceberg Lake (or Ptarmigan Falls).  Instead we did 7.2  miles around Swiftcurrent, Josephine and Grinnell lakes.  The thing about hiking is that you always feel fine when you make the bad decision that takes you just a little bit further than your feet would like to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="swiftcurrent" src="/images/Glacier/swiftcurrent_lake.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the theme of this post, it is also clear that I am not a good person to lead the hikers. My stride is too long and my pace is too fast.  "Slow Down!"&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="RV"></category><category term="Glacier"></category></entry><entry><title>Tie Your RV Down</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/tie-your-rv-down.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-25T21:15:56-05:00</published><updated>2016-06-25T21:15:56-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-06-25:/PelicanBlog/tie-your-rv-down.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MacDonalds Lodge" src="/images/Glacier/macdonalds_lodge.jpeg"&gt;

As we got in the car to head over to the hot tub at the KOA in St. Mary's Montana, I pointed to the rope tied to the rear view mirror of the RV and the picnic table.  I said it looks like we tied the RV to the picnic table to keep it from blowing away!  Ha, imagine a picnic table holding back a 32 foot Winnebago in a 25 mph wind!?  But 20 - 25 mph winds are what you get in St. Marys, just east of the continental divide.  We had a lot of wind all day yesterday and today as we drove from Banff to Glacier.  This area is known for its wind and highway 22 even had signs with warning lights for RVs and trucks for days when the wind is gusting and dangerous!  Thankfully it was not bad for us at the time we drove that stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are in a KOA campground, a source of some discontent amongst the group.  however it has a hot tub, pool, and laundry facilities.  These are all good things after a week of traveling together.  Plus they also rent cars that you can take on the road to the sun.  This is good as our RV would never be allowed to attempt the journey.  The roads are indeed very narrow, and the rocks overhang on one side and would definitely tear off parts of the RV!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning we got up and were on our way by about 8:00 on the "road to the sun". The main problem was that the sun was not cooperating!  When we got to Logan's pass we could barely see in front of the car because we were right in the middle of the clouds.  But, we kept on going and in the end we were rewarded, not with sunshine, but with "lord of the rings" mystical beauty.  The above photo is from MacDonald's Lodge.  Although the national park is called glacier, it could more appropriately be called waterfall national park at this point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Waterfall" src="/images/Glacier/waterfall1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After MacDonald's Lodge we took the Avalanche Lake hike!   Wow, was this pretty, even in the dripping rain the sites along the way and once we got to the lake were well worth the hike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Avalanche Lake" src="/images/Glacier/avalange_lake1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Avalanche Lake" src="/images/Glacier/avalanche_lake2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the hike we headed back the other direction on the road to the sun and by this time the clouds had lifted enough for us to really enjoy the scenery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Glacier Valley" src="/images/Glacier/glacier_valley.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course no trip to Glacier, in June, would be complete without photos of the giant snowdrifts-cum-glaciers that we humans plow out of the way for the tourists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Avalanche Lake" src="/images/Glacier/big_drift.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, no trip to Glacier would be complete without a picture of Goose Island!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A clean underwear!" came the shout from the bedroom of the RV.  "Thanks Holly, you just provided me with the opening line for today's blog."  After a morning of touring the sites on the road to Jasper, we are back in the RV, having lost our will to hike in the rain.  In the gloom and rain of the day I would say that the Columbia Ice sheet and all of the surrounding glaciers was actually a little depressing.  You just can't help but see how much they have shrunk over the years, and we overheard people talking.  "When I was here 20 years ago, this glacier came right up to the road." Now the glacier in question is a good kilometer back from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as we are taking this downtime to shower and cleanup a bit in preparation for our move south tomorrow, I'm taking a few minutes this afternoon to catch up a little.  There is only so much you can write about all of this mountain beauty.  On the other hand it seems as though just when we think we've seen the most beautiful site, something new comes along and surprises us.  so I'm just going to include some pictures today with a minimum amount of commentary.  I think they speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo at the top is from Bow Lake, right off the highway.  But everything was so still it was crazy beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Close up Reflection" src="/images/Canada/reflection_close_up.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one may trip you up a bit.  It is a closeup of the mountain reflection, but the stones in the foreground are not a reflection.  It looks kind of weird without the perspective of the real landscape!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Peyto lake" src="/images/Canada/peyto_lake.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Peyto Lake, just a short hike off the highway, it is well worth the stop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunwapta Falls" src="/images/Canada/sunwapta_falls.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunwapta Falls was another really short hike off the highway, with spectacular falls.  The power of the water never ceases to amaze. I was messing around with shutter speeds to get the effect you see in this photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Emerald Lake" src="/images/Canada/emerald_lake.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hiked around Emerald lake, I think you can guess how it got its name.  Emerald Lake is in Yoho national park in British Columbia.  If I had written this post yesterday I would have titled it "Yoho, Yoho a Pirates Life for Me!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Natural Bridge" src="/images/Canada/natural_bridge.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another beautiful waterfall, next to a spot you could easily drive by and dismiss.  But well worth the stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Natural Bridge" src="/images/Canada/natural_bridge2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another which gives you a better view of its bridge like qualities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="RV"></category><category term="Canada"></category></entry><entry><title>Wardrobe Malfunction at the Hot Springs</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/wardrobe-malfunction-at-the-hot-springs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-22T07:58:41-05:00</published><updated>2016-06-22T07:58:41-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-06-22:/PelicanBlog/wardrobe-malfunction-at-the-hot-springs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Moraine Lake" src="/images/Canada/anniversay_pic.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Anniversary!  Jane and I have been married 30 years today.  People will say that is quite an accomplishment these days, I just can't believe that 30 years have gone by so quickly.  We have two amazing children that have grown into wonderful young adults.  Yes, one of them is older than we were when we got married.  We have had 30 years of incredible adventures, we have seen a pretty good fraction of the world, and are looking forward to seeing lots more of it.  I've had a pretty great career doing what I love.  I couldn't have done any of it without Jane.  Thanks honey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started today at Moraine Lake, its smaller than Lake Louise, and when you walk up to the waters edge you might think, meh, not as blue as Louise either.  But if you climb up the rocks near the waters edge you don't have to go very far before you realize its just a matter of perspective.  Of course climbing the rocks was part of the fun, but once we got to the top we realized there was a much easier way to get there!  After absorbing the view for a while we made our way down (the easy way) and did a short walk along the lake shore.  The sun started to come out, so we made our way back up and you can see how different the colors are in the sunlight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Moraine Sun" src="/images/Canada/sunny_morraine.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Moraine Lake we headed down the Bow River Parkway towards Banff.  Supposedly the wildlife is more plentiful along the parkway that the four lane freeway.  There are so many places you could stop and hike or stop and view the scenery that we really had to pick and choose.  Our main stop on the way down was at Johnston Canyon.  We hiked our way up to the lower falls and were rewarded with some really great views.  I'm always amazed at the power of these streams and waterfalls.  You can really appreciate the power of water over the centuries as you see how this deep narrow canyon was formed by the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Johnston Canyon" src="/images/Canada/johnston_canyon.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now it was lunch time and we headed for downtown Banff.  Our first goal was for lunch, with a strong subgoal of finding a place where we could watch the USA versus Argentina soccer match later.  We found ourselves at Park Distillery.  They had the Euro on TV, but unfortunately they did not get FS1.  Apparently with Canada not part of the Copa FS1 is not a priority in Banff, as this became a real theme as we went from place to place.  First everyone assured us they got soccer, but when I clarified that we wanted the Copa America tournament, not the Euro things went downhill.  After receiving multiple assurances that the Bear Street tavern did indeed get the Copa, we decided we were safe and could be about our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop of the day was the Banff Hot Springs.  I will admit this seemed a bit cheesy to me, but after a few days of hiking who can resist a nice hot soak.  You can rent everything you need at the Banff Hot Springs, including historical bathing suits.  Holly &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have done this as she forgot a critical part of her top back in the RV.  Leaving her with a slightly thin top.  Despite my reservations, and the fact the Hot Springs really were nothing more than a a big swimming pool full of hot mineral water the soak felt great, and we all got an extra shower!  The quote of the day, was in the car on the way to the Banff Hotel when Holly was having further wardrobe problems and was heard to say "I can't find them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hot Springs" src="/images/Canyon/hot_springs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short tour of the Banff Hotel, we headed back downtown for some shopping and wandering around town.  Basically wasting time until the game started.  At 6:30 we headed over to the Bear Street Tavern to take up our seats and wait for the game to start, only to be told that it would be an hour and a half wait for a table with no guarantee of seeing a TV.  Horrors!  Fine then, off we go to the Pump and Tap tavern.  Described by the hostess of the Park Distillery as "a dive bar". But being that it was an English pub they did get the game. In fact the owner had purchased a package just this week to ensure that they would get the Copa.  No credit cards accepted, no table service, but lots of TVs and some decent beer.  They had a very short menu with a number of deep fried options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pump and Tap" src="/images/Canada/pump_and_tap.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before halftime we got a text from Bear Street that our table was available.  Brian went to investigate.  Site lines to the TV?  Copa available?  As it turned out there was a view of the TV, but they did not have the package that allowed them to see the Copa.  We were at the only place in town that carried the game.  As time wore on, more and more USA fans filed in to watch the game.  Then Messi kicked that wondrous free kick to put Argentina up 2 - 0 and all we could do was be impressed at how good the guy is.  Right after halftime Argentina went up 3 - 0 and our stomachs said we should find some good food, so we made our table available to more diehard USA fans and headed down the street to the Coyote Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't arrive back at the RV until after 9:30 which meant that it was a 12 hour day of touring and enjoying the sites around Banff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in our campsite in Banff, my feet are up, I have a Gin &amp;amp; Tonic next to me, the campfire is started, the sun is still high in the sky, it's 18:00.  My iPhone tells me that I have taken 35,196 steps and gone 14.6 miles today!  I believe the G&amp;amp;T is well earned. We are thinking of ordering pizza from Temple Pizza at the Fairmont hotel on Lake Louise because NOBODY WANTS TO GET OUT OF THEIR CHAIR!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to say, is that today is totally a gift!  The forecast was calling for rain but today was absolutely beautiful!  Sunny and nice all day long.  We had a perfect view of the mountains and everything else around Lake Louise today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started out cool, with temps down to 35 overnight.  Its OK, as Willard has a furnace to keep us nice and comfortable.  But we all totally overdressed for the hike today, as I think it got well above the advertised high of 67 degrees.  We thought this was our warmup hike of only 10K round trip.  So Brian and I said we would ride our bikes up the road to Lake Louise.  According to our best information it was only supposed to be 200 meters of elevation over 4 kilometers of distance.  A slope of only 1/20. Someone Lied!  it was 4k of straight up hill, lets just say we were warmed up by the time we got to the lake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the obligatory, but still totally beautiful,  pictures at the the Chateau and then we headed out for our hike to the Tea House in the Six Glaciers Plain.  Six is definitely and overstatement, and if anyone thinks that global warming is a "hoax" they are idiots.  If you think global warming is a hoax, I'm sorry if I've offended you, but science is not a matter of opinion. Science is based on observation and analysis and the evidence shows that the glaciers are MUCH SMALLER than they were 100 years ago.  Why would glaciers be smaller?  Higher average temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the hike was still beautiful, and Brian even managed to see a chunk of glacier break off and fall off the cliff.  The rest of us heard it, but by then it was too late!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to get out of bed this morning.  The rain was making rainy sounds on the roof and there was a chill in the air.  Windows were cracked open an it was only in the 40's outside.  Someone had to get up and start the coffee.  Also, it seemed like a great time to try the heater.  I'm not sure it had been used before as it had that new furnace smell to it as it warmed up our little home.  This got everyone out of bed and eating breakfast.  It is Father's day today.  I've had electronic wishes  from both Kaia and Josh.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the rain our departure was pretty easy.  Unplug, retract, and go.  It was rainy and windy as we left the campsite, the rain ended pretty quickly but the wind hounded us all the way past Calgary.  We had quite the experience of refueling at the Costco gas station!    We pulled off Highway 1 expecting an easy (and cheap) experience only to find the lines 6 cars deep.  Thankfully there was a nice guy directing traffic who got us over to the line for the end pump.  It could have been a real disaster trying to make the turn out of the station if we didn't have the extra room.  We are finding that we are limited to $150 worth of gas which seems to be about half a tank!!  We can go from 1/4 to 3/4 on a $150 charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Calgary we left the plains of Alberta and climbed into the beautiful Canadian Rockies!  We are really getting the hang of setting up camp.  Less than five minutes today.  We'll have to move our campsite by about 30 feet tomorrow as we are camped next to the site we have reserved for the next few days.  After a quick lunch in the RV we decided to take a bike ride to the Village for some ice and then hike along the Bow River.  As you can see the scenery is pretty nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning we left the Pratt's at 8:00, right on schedule.  I took my first shift in the cockpit.  This thing drives pretty nicely except when the wind gets gusty.  Then you feel like you are constantly overcorrecting one way or the other.  As we buzzed along I94 through North Dakota, we realized that we were not really in the spirit of things.  No large balls of twine, no giant ears of corn!  Of course, there's an app for that!  "Road Trippers" to the rescue!  In no time at all we learned that Jamestown had the worlds largest buffalo monument.  After a quick stop at Cenex to top off our tank (38 gallons for about half a tank),  we ended up on a really bad gravel road that brought us into the frontier village from the wrong direction.   Oh well, we got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pratts" src="/images/fargo_stop.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are headed towards Bizmark for lunch and maybe a glimpse of the worlds largest Holstein!  Wait, how much giant bovine statuary can we see in one day?!  We shall see... the Holstein is reportedly some 40 feet tall and 50 feet long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking up the story a bit later, we have crossed the border into Canada!  A relatively painless and friendly process.  When the border guard asked if we would be staying in Canada long term, we told her it depended on the outcome of the election.  She smiled and said she was hearing that a lot.  Its 4:30 now, and we have another hour to go before we get to Weyburn for the night.  We are not making quite as fast progress as we thought but its been a pretty easy day except for the gusty winds.  I've taken my second shift driving, and it was definitely much better heading into the wind than having it directly across this big beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much scenery yet, just a lot of wide open spaces and oil wells.  At one point we saw big big numbers on the side of the hills outlined in stone.  I suspected it was UFO markings --  the infamous "area 15", Brian thought they were targets for bombing practice from the Air Force base.  Holly looked it up on Google and learned that it was a local high school tradition to spell out their graduation year in rock on one of the local hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed into the mountain time zone just before we got to Weyburn, Saskatchewan for the night, which meant that we were right on schedule for happy hour.  I like this RV style of camping, it took us less than 10 minutes to level up, connect the electricity and the water.  We rolled out the canopy and set up our soccer chairs poured drinks, and by 5:15 we were relaxing and enjoying our campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Camping" src="/images/first_camp.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner we took the bikes into town, and ended up at Boston Pizza.  Jane and Holly both ordered a Bloody Caesar (like a Bloody Mary but Canadian). The waitress offered "fishbowl size" little did we know that they would actually be served in a fish bowl!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bloody Caesars" src="/images/boston_pizza.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on the road this morning having successfully navigated the dumping station!  More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="RV"></category></entry><entry><title>Packing up and Heading Out</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/packing-up-and-heading-out.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-06-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-06-17:/PelicanBlog/packing-up-and-heading-out.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mobile blogging!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="looking ahead" src="/images/frontview.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to start?  We awoke this morning and split our preparatory duties.  The women went to Costco, the men took Tucker back home and picked up the rest of the knutson's belongings.  By 1:00 we had two SUVs FULL Of stuff to put in our 32 foot Winnebago, henceforth known as Willard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="full car" src="/images/fullcar.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Rent and Travel just before 2:00, our appointed time to take possession of Willard.  After about 30 minutes (only) of introduction and education (which we recorded for later reference) we began the 90 minute process of moving in.  Food, lawn games, photography equipment, adult beverages, hiking gear, clothing, bedding, adult beverages, grilling equipment.  All the comforts of home for the next 15 days and 2,800 miles.  It was hot sweaty work, but we are all packed up and on the road.  Jane, of course, is taking the first shift of driving this giant beast.  Brian is riding shotgun and Holly and I are trying out RV travel in the back.  I'm sitting at the kitchen table writing as we go.  I just saw the sign that says Morehead 198 that is our destination for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be parking at the home of our friends Dave and Carol Pratt tonight.  Dave just texted us that he was going to get some beer and put some ribs on the grill to slow cook for us.  We should be in Morehead by around 7:30 for our practice night of leveling, setting up, and trying things out without a lot of neighboring campers watching us mess around.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="RV"></category></entry><entry><title>Prelude to a Recreational Vehicle</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/prelude-to-a-recreational-vehicle.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-06-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-06-16:/PelicanBlog/prelude-to-a-recreational-vehicle.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/nsc.jpg" title="A night with the Loons"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for our big RV adventure Brian, Holly, Jane and I all attended the Minnesota United FC match tonight.  The match was played against Sporting KC as part of the open tournament, similar to the FA cup in England.  We arrived early to check out the food trucks and the atmosphere around the stadium that the regulars refer to as the Nessi (National Sports Center NSC, get it?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were enjoying our Bahn Mi sandwiches and a nice Summit EPA a dude dressed as a blue dinosaur/shark with a megaphone came to stand beside us.  He proceeded to start heckling the Sporting KC keeper and his coach, as they were going through their pregame drills.  We thought it was a bit odd that he sounded pretty normal when he was chatting with other people (obviously he's a regular at the games) but his heckling voice had a definite Scottish brogue to it.  As the Sporting KC players were taking their shots on goal we noticed that the last of the shots were all going over the bar and getting increasingly close to this guy (and us). The final shot was right on target as it hit him right in the megaphone.  Later we learned that he was sort of a mascot called Nessi.  Apparently the Loch Ness monster must look like a blue dino.  It all makes sense now, even the Scottish accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of the game was a bit boring to be honest.  The ref seemed content to let pretty much everything go with nothing but a stern talking to, the Loons had no shots on goal, no corners and no points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things picked up a lot in the second half, including the referees use of the yellow card.  There should have been a red as on of the KC players attacked a MUFC player from behind.  Then KC scored first on a very dubious handball in the box.  I hate it when a player goes down and they call a handball on that player when the ball hits the arm on the ground.  Sacrifice your face and let yourself fall on your nose so you don't get a handball.   Benny Fielhaber took the PK and made it 1 - nil for KC.  Suddenly the game came to life.  The Loons definitely started to get more of the ball and went on the attack much more often.  KC seemed to get more and more aggressive with their tackles as the guys in green let them play while punishing the Minnesotans for even the most minor of infractions.  Eventually their evil ways caught up with them and Minnesota was awarded a PK for a really vicious tackle in the box.  1-1, game on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular time ended in a draw so we went to overtime.   KC seemed to find another  gear and I had the sense that it was only a matter of time until they scored and put the game away.  Which they did only to have the goal ruled out for offsides.  A few minutes later they came back and scored again.  Minnesota tried desperately to get back in it, but never really got a shot on target to level things out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>The Bucket Dive</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/scuba-refresher-plus-sailing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-03-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-03-20:/PelicanBlog/scuba-refresher-plus-sailing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Bucket Dive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our dive logs it's been 13 years since we did our last dive.  So, when we decided to make a last minute trip to the Caribbean for Spring Break this year we decided that one of our activities should be a refresher dive to get current.  This turned out to be a great decision.  We thought that doing the refresher early in the cruise would be good, since it would allow us the flexibility of doing a second dive later on.  The bonus was that the Bucket Regatta was happening in St. Bart's so the dive turned into a dive plus several hours in a Zodiac "chasing the race"   Wow!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the pier at 9:30 and we were greeted by a French woman, Isabelle.  She was busy unpacking tanks and BV's etc, but was very friendly.  We asked if we needed to do any paperwork, assuming the standard waivers etc.  "No, we are French" she said as if that was all the explanation we needed.  We were joined by a dozen other French speaking people, all much younger than us. When did this happen?  We used to be the younger ones on these adventures!  It was totally unclear which of them were assistants, and which of them were other guests like us.  After getting everyone organized, Emmanuel, the Captain, told us that we would be diving with Elizabeth.  "Who is Elizabeth?"  I asked.  "She is the blonde Woman, my wife.   my wife" he said with a grin.   The refresher turned out to be just the perfect amount of review.  It's just like riding a bike Isabelle told us. She was right.  After a few minutes we were enjoying the freedom of exploring the reef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under water we saw, a couple of Barracuda, a sea turtle napping in a little alcove, a bunch of HUGE lobster, and a couple of grouchy eels.  We also saw the usual assortment of Tangs and Wrasse, Parrotfish and Lionfish.  After a slow start, my ears started to clear a bit easier and I made it down 60 feet.  A very good dive.  A day later, as I write this I'm still waiting for my inner ears to clear, which is a problem I had 13 years ago.  It's not painful, just a bit unpleasant to hear the world a bit muffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the diving done, the next part of our adventure was just getting started.  As usual, I guess I hadn't really been paying attention, but the bonus part of our dive was that we were now going to "chase the race."  We knew that there was a huge regatta happing on St. Bart's, but to follow the sailboats in our Zodiac was a real experience.  First, the beauty of these huge boats is just amazing.  With the sun gleaming off the huge white sails they were really spectacular.  It was shocking to watch them fly past us completely silently, listing 30 degrees or more with their sails full of wind.  As you can see these were not small inexpensive sailboats either, these were big luxury boats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/IMG_0010.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the excitement of chasing the boats, and it is really interesting how close we got to several of them, 30 - 60 feet probably.  Close enough to greet the crew!  But the swells today made for a pretty fun boat ride.  Its always a little weird when you are in the boat look up at the tops of the waves!  Emmanuel was clearly having fun driving and getting us airborn.  Isabelle kept giving him the kind of stern look that says, "maybe you want to slow down a bit?" But he didn't seem to notice, and we didn't really mind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total we made a complete circle of the island, and when we made our turn to go with the wind, and "surf the waves" for a smooth ride home we were also rewarded with the site of one of the big ships letting out its spinnaker!  Up it went, and then Boom!  the sail filled with the wind that would propel it toward the finish line.  You just can't believe how big those sails are until you are right there when they go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/IMG_0015.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that we were back at the pier and unloading our gear.  Sunburned and very tired from a day in the sun and water.  We had to hike the long way back around the bay to get to our pickup with the ships tender, and we realized then how intense the sun was.  We just missed the tender as we came within site, but 15 minutes later they were back and without waiting an extra minute we were on our way back to the SeaDream I.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow we managed to stay awake until dinner time at 7:30, and we chose to eat outside.  Jane had Lobster and I had a really delicious Veal Saltimbocca.  We were joined by our new friends from Florida and had a very nice dinner.  We are definitely enjoying our time here on the SeaDream.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="SCUBA"></category><category term="Caribbean"></category></entry><entry><title>No Easy Solutions</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/no-easy-solutions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2016-01-24:/PelicanBlog/no-easy-solutions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you were king how would you end poverty?

Not an easy question to answer, even if you were king &lt;strong&gt;with a magic wand&lt;/strong&gt; its not an easy problem to solve.  Neverthless it was a question that one of our intrepid students put to a Stanford professor one day.  This became a common question that we asked almost everyone we met with, and it was a question that generated a lot of good group conversation.  I would like to summarize a few of the answers we heard and add my own half-baked idea at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we visited Dr. David Grusky at the Stanford Center for Poverty and inequality.  I took away a couple of key points from this meeting.  One of their key tasks is to get better and more frequent data about poverty in the United States.  Larry told us that the data we have today is collected too infrequently and by the time the data is published it is nine months out of date!  Wow, thats crazy.  The software development manager in me says, &amp;quot;you can't fix what you can't measure&amp;quot;  If we are not measuring poverty how can we hope to make progress toward fixing it.  Hint:  We can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of a big solution Dr. Grusky expressed his idea quite eloquently.  &amp;quot;We have to make everyone live together.&amp;quot;  At first I rejected the idea as overly simple and impractical.  But the more I thought about it the more I liked it.  Making people of all income levels live next to each other would surely build community, where we would not see each other as &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; but rather as friends and neighbors.  Who doesn't want to help their neighbors?  Who is my neighbor is a question that has been nagging us since the disciples first asked the question of Jesus a couple thousand years ago.  The more we live in community the more we see each other as people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to the theme of Decorah in the previous post, I think this really is one of the strengths of a small town.  Rich people, middle income people, and poor people all live together.  Maybe not next door, but definitely on the same block.  Our kids go to the same schools and participate on the same teams and choirs and bands together.  We meet parents over the common ground of our kids and their achievements.  Over the years one of the most amazing aspects of the Decorah schools to me is that there is such a high level of mutual respect among students no matter what they do.  The &amp;quot;jocks&amp;quot; are also in the choir, and if not they scertainly support the choir, and vice versa.  Its this kind of integration that leads to great things.  If you don't believe me I'll tell you that Decorah has won the Iowa Challenge cup so many times in the last ten years that people at the state just call it the &amp;quot;Decorah prize.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why is this so important?  The more integrated we become, and the more we see each other as friends and peers the more we will help each other solve our problems.  The more integrated we live the more our kids go to the same schools.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In broad terms the next set of solutions revolve around &lt;strong&gt;economic mobility&lt;/strong&gt;, that is how do we get people to move up the economic ladder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One answer to this question that came up several times was around education. Even our own president Carlson took a shot at this question at an alumni event we attended.  Education leads to opportunity and  or the ability to move up the economic ladder.  &lt;a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/privilege-and-inequality-in-silicon-valley-92d455b66860"&gt;Here's a great story that illustrates&lt;/a&gt;  Of course not everyone gets to go to Stanford and tap into the amazing group of VC's and successful entrepreneurs that are part of the Stanford alumni network.  But education opens many doors to higher paying jobs no matter where it comes from.  The theme of education was also evident at the &lt;a href="http://www.creativecommons.org"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; where we discussed open source licensing models and how organizations like Open MIT and others are making high quality courseware available on the web.  This of course is not unlike what we are doing at &lt;a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org"&gt;Runestone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another really interesting discussion about economic mobility comes from &lt;a href="http://kiva.org"&gt;Kiva&lt;/a&gt; .  While Kiva has been making loans abroad for a few years, Kiva has started to make micro loans (up to $10,000) right here in the United States.  The Kiva story goes something like this.  A micro loan is not going to vault you up the economic ladder, it may not even get you onto the first rung.  But it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; give you a foothold on the ladder where you might just be able to reach the first rung with a little time and experience. Without the microlending infrastructure in place, we wondered how Kiva decides who to loan to.  The answer is simple, &amp;quot;If you can show us that you have convinced 25 people to loan you 25 dollars then we will put you on the site.&amp;quot; Between Kiva and the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University we have enough examples of these small scale loans in action to make it very believable that it is a path up the economic ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

The streets are safe, the children of our community all get a good education from the public schools.  For the most part, those that want to continue their education after high school are able to do that, making use of the Iowa tuition grant or perhaps even the tuition exchange program if one of their parents works for Luther.   One can buy a house in Decorah for 100,000.00 maybe less, and certainly for more.  Apartments are available in 450.00 range for a one bedroom unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area south of San Francisco, known as Silicon Valley could not be more different.  In San Jose a one bedroom apartment goes for 2200/month, almost times the cost in Decorah!   There is an even larger gap if you want to buy a house.  A small  three bedroom rambler in Palo Alto or Mountain View can go for 1.2 million dollars or 10 times the cost of a similarly sized house in Decorah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum wage in Iowa is \$7.25/hour, the minimum wage in California is \$9.00/hr in San Jose the minimum wage is 10.30 per hour, better than Iowa and California in general but still… Here’s a math problem for you, how many minimum wage jobs does it take to cover the rent on a 1-bedroom apartment in San Jose?  Definitely more than one!  Housing in this area is a huge problem even for people in the tech industry making six figure incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the issues we have been grappling with the past three weeks as we have visited companies and community organizers and social service organizations in the heart of high tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set foot on the campus of Facebook or Google its like you’ve entered a theme park.  Brightly colored buildings, statues of popsicles, ice cream sandwiches, and cuddly green Androids at Google.  Disney-esque restaurants where employees eat free breakfast, lunch, and dinner at most places we visited.  Hair cuts, oil changes, laundry services, an on-site doctor for your sore throat are not uncommon at the most profitable tech companies.  If you live in the city and commute to Mountain View climb aboard a pristine white bus, complete with WiFi to take you on your journey to work.  Once again complementary.  Clearly, a degree in computer science is a golden ticket in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the driver of that bus?  What about the person cooking your free meals?  Cleaning the “streets” and floors and bathrooms in your wonderland workspace?  They must buy their own lunch, and drive themselves to work, and pay for their own hair cuts, or heaven forbid they get sick and need to go to the doctor.  How do they pay for all of this, especially on $10/hr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk down Market street from our cozy four bedroom VRBO unit in the Castro neighborhood towards the Embarcadero we pass many homeless people, many are chronically homeless, which means they struggle with mental illness, addiction, and other health issues.  They say weird things, they have all of their possessions in a cart or a bag.  Some of them dig through the garbage to find cans and bottles we casually toss aside to redeem for some change and the chance for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be easy to think that big profitable tech companies are the root of all of these problems.  Housing, public transportation, and other services simply cannot keep up with the appetite these places have for high tech employees.  All of which drives up the cost of housing even more.  We are told that every new high tech job in the six figures creates four ancillary positions for jobs like nannies, house keepers, and gardeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth many of the titans of Silicon Valley are doing a lot to help.  Nearly every non-profit we met with gets funding from Google.  Facebook agreed with a union to pay their bus drivers $28.00/hr. Most companies are in business to make life better for someone.  Whether it is through providing emergency commmunication during times of crisis like Facebook, or encouraging people to live a more healthy lifestyle like Strava.  No one company is going to do anything to solve the whole problem, but lots of them are trying to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of housing, we think Facebook is also responsible for a massive new apartment complex just a block away from their campus.  Of course even this brings with it questions.  The apartment complex is several blocks along on a street with few outlets, and very old, small houses across the street.  The traffic that this new complex will add has nowhere to go.  One can hope that if the complex is designed for Facebook employees they will all choose to walk to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the limited space available in the valley you might think that building up would be an option.  Unfortunately most cities limit the height of new construction which further hampers the ability of developers to add high density housing.  On top of all of this when new developments are created then there are cries of gentrification from long time residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to be a no win situation.  Further success and growth by innovative companies brings in more people which exacerbates traffic, housing, and contributes to the higher cost of living.  One wonders why this remains the mecca for high tech.  Why not go elsewhere?  The simple answer is because there is no where else like this.  All of the pieces for a successful startup are just down the block.  Money, legal, technical talent are all here.  Ideas permeate the air in every bar, restaurant and street corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the solution?  We asked most everyone we met with for their solution and unsurprisingly we got a different answer for everyone.  I’ll summarize those in my next post…&lt;/p&gt;

With the rulings of the supreme court back home this week, it is easy to feel like we are returning to a country that is better off today than it was six months ago.

&lt;p&gt;Today we spent the majority of our day biking from the center of Prague to Karlštejn Castle 35km away.  We have done a bike outing in almost every country we have visited, and today was no different.  It is such a great way to see the country side and the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had an exceptional few days in Prague, mostly because of meeting so many good friends who were experiencing Luther's Bach and Bonhoeffer tour.  We toured with the group dined with friends, and hosted a happy hour for the group on our amazing terrace.  It was almost like being home with so many great people around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its hard to say what my favorite stop was on this trip.  I enjoyed seeing the old city of Dubrovnik and hiking around the walls.  I enjoyed our hike from Fira to Oia on Santorini (despite the fact that it was hot and I complained about the heat)  I enjoyed our scooter rental explorations on Patmos.  I enjoyed our tour, rug bargaining, and the evening concert in Ephesus, I enjoyed our cooking class in Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minus the screwup on our suite, the Azamara experience was really nice and relaxing.  We enjoyed the fact that drinks were included, and so we didn't have pocketsful of paper for signing for anything and everything.   We enjoyed our freedom to dine in the specialty restaurants (Prime-C and Aqualina) whenever we wanted, and we had a great time at the best-of-the-best night with the other suite guests.   The formal table service was a show unto itself, with all of our butlers serving us in synchrony like the servants at Downton Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;

A cooking class.  Other than the kebabs we enjoyed during our previous visit we really didn't get to learn that much about Turkish cuisine so we decided to sign up for a cooking class with &lt;a href="www.cookistan.com"&gt;Cookistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an (overpriced) cab from the docks up to the Radisson Plaza where we met our instructor for the day along with a bunch of (much younger) cooking enthusiasts.  Our instructor, Ayşın, was phenomenal.  She had a great sense of humor, and great timing in everything we did that day.  We started out with a walking tour of her neighborhood to get a sense for the kinds of small shops that people use today in modern Istanbul.  When we arrived at the cooking school this was all set up for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/cookistan.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Our cooking stations, all setup for us at Cookistan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The menu for the day can be seen on the chalk board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suliman Soup -- Yes, I now officially like lentil soup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borecik -- a delicous meat mixture baked in pastry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuffed dried Aubergine -- even though aubergine sounds a lot better than eggplant, I'm still not a huge fan.  Although they were not too bad.  We also used the same mixture to stuff grape leaves and I really liked that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulgur Salad  -- Again, a new salad, and I'm fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circassian Style Chicken.  Kind of a cold chicken salad that you can eat with a spoon or put on bread for a sandwich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin Dessert -- Maybe the only thing all day I really didn't appreciate.  -- It was too much like eating sweet squash for my palete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a very small world moment you can see the young man in this picture with me, who works on the same team at Epic with one of my former students!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The cat, of all things, stole the show.  Earlier in the day we had learned about the cats of Ephesus.  Apparently the archeological team working on the excavation of the ancient city published a book, but it was about the cats rather than about substantial archeological issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Ephesus/concert.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it was no surprise that when 500 of us had settled into the Odeon for a 13 piece string orchestra plus harp, that the cats decided to see what was going on.  One of them decided it must have had front row seats, as it seated itself right on top of the stone wall front and center behind the orchestra.  Then as the first piece started the cat started to meow. Loud enough that it could be heard alongside the harp.  The orchestra got the giggles.  The ship's staff was mortified.  Too afraid to grab the cat and drag it out of their they tried to call it (quietly) and the head of guest services tried to shush it!  Really, you do not shush a cat.  Now, I know this will come as a shock to some, but I am not a cat lover.  I barely tolerate their presence.  But this was stereotypical cat and stereotypical human behavior at its funniest.  I only wish that I had been smart enough to video the whole thing because this is America's Funniest Home Videos GOLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the cat was mostly a fan of the harp, because it moved on after the harpist left the stage.  From then on we could really enjoy the music and the small orchestra.  The concert was definitely a greatest hits type of concert:  Bach: Air, Boccherini: Minuet, Mozart: Eine Kliene Nacht Musik, and Brahms: Hungarian Dance No: 5.  The Güçan brothers stole the show in the final number with a Violin versus Viola duel that everyone laughing and cheering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between all of this great music was the realization that we were sitting in the Odeon theater of Ephesus.  Built in the 2nd century AD we sat on the same stones that  Marc Antony and Cleopatra may have sat upon when they were here.  The Odeon was the center of city government, and cultural events in early Ephesus.  With the sun setting behind us it was an evening we will not forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Ephesus/library.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day we did a private tour of Ephesus and it was amazing.  About halfway through the tour I turned to Jane and said, &amp;quot;I'm feeling a little bad we did not bring the students down here when we were in Istanbul.&amp;quot;  Of all of the ancient ruins of ancient cities we have visited this would definitely be in my top three.  The terraced houses, and the library (with its tunnel to the Brothel across the street) are just spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop of the day was at the temple of Artemis.   There is just one column remaining but from there you can get a great view of this ancient pagan temple along with a Muslim mosque and the Basilica of St. John.  Quite a combination.&lt;/p&gt;

And what a great way to cover it we discovered.  Scooters!  Not our usual biking fare, but the island is very hilly and we wanted to cover more ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Patmos/scooterSelfie.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Scooter Selfie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we got off the ship and made the short walk to Moto-Leo.  A distinctly family run scooter rental operation.  Father and daughter, with no deposit or arduous paperwork to rent for the day.  Which the daily rental was only 15 euro.  So it was also a very cheap way to see the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole island reminded us of small town living.  Although Patmos is a Christian Pilgrimage destination, and they obviously get cruise ships stopping in, the island has not succumbed to that overly touristic feeling.  We loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the island is the Cave of the Apocalypse, where St. John wrote the book of Revelations.  Its pretty small, and they don't let you take pictures inside, so other than saying it looked like a small cave-like  chapel there is not much more to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above the cave sits a monastery and this was our second stop for the day.  After parking the scooters and starting the walk up the hill  I noticed something that was definitely out of place on the top of Patmos.  A &amp;quot;Hawkeye Rd&amp;quot; sign.  Really?!  An Iowa Hawkeye sign on this tiny small island in Greece.  &amp;quot;Iowa Hawkeyes!&amp;quot;  I exclaimed.  Then I met Jimmy.  &amp;quot;Are you from Iowa?&amp;quot; he asked?  &amp;quot;yes, from Decorah&amp;quot; I said.   &amp;quot;Oh, thats just north of Independence isn't it?&amp;quot;  Clearly this dude knew his Iowa geography!  &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; I said.   &amp;quot;Well, people from Iowa get free coffee, come in, come in!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Patmos/JimmyTheGreek.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Note the Hawkeye Rd sign!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned from Jimmy that he had lived in Iowa some 13 years until he inherited this building, which brought him back to the island.  He has a fantastic view, and is obviously doing quite well with the restaurant and the gift shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Patmos/ViewFromJimmys.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing the only two touristic things on the island we took off on our scooters to explore the nooks and crannies of the island.  We saw lots of beautiful little secluded beaches and coves that would be perfect for swimming or snorkeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

Azamara was definitely the smallest with just under 700 passengers, but the Celebrity Equinox more than made up for our size.  So it was probably over 6000 people descending on the city for the day.  In response, the port officials had to stage all of the tender operations so as to not completely overwhelm their ability to welcome people to their city.  Meaning, the gondola ride to the top and the poor donkeys carrying people not willing to wait in line for the gondola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Santorini/santoriniharbor.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many nice things about the Azamara line is that we stay in port longer than anyone else.  Whereas most cruise lines will arrive at a port around 8AM and leave by 5PM Azamara will stay until 10 or 11PM.  This has many great benefits in that you can stay ashore much longer, and even have dinner on shore if you like.  Or if you have dinner on the ship you are doing it while the ship is anchored!  It also goes a long way to reducing the stress around getting out and back from a shore excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when we arrived on shore the line to take the cable car up the hill stretched across the port.  It looked like it was going to take two hours just to get into town but in the end the lined moved fairly quickly and it was only 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island of Santorini is really just the rim of an ancient volcanic caldera that sticks up above the water.  Its easy to see the outline of the circle in this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Santorini/calderaisland.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal for the day was to escape the crowds in the city by hiking from Fira to Oia a five mile walk along the rim of the caldera.  Through all of the white villages with their shops and hotels. It sounded pretty easy and it didn't even look like a very long walk when we were starting out.  But it felt a lot longer as there was no breeze and the temperature got up to 32 C or about 90 F.  The title of this post is a bit dramatic, as it was not that bad of a walk, and although in a few places we walked through volcanic gravel that insisted on getting in our shoes we had 3 hours of amazing views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Santorini/destination.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The long walk to Oia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Oia we badly needed a shower, or a dip in one of the many pools we passed on the way.  Instead we found a nice little shady restaurant and revived ourselves with some carbonara and a glass of wine.  We had escaped the crowds of Fira, seen a lot of beautiful scenery, and worked off a few calories hiking in the heat.  It was a great day. Yes, it felt like a forced march a few times along the path to Oia in the heat, but as part of life's journeys this was worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back on the ship is was Azamara's white night night.  Everyone was out on deck dressed in white and the crew was serving a great dinner.  They had the webber kettle going and there were some great greek kabobs and other good food.  To top off the evening we watched another great sunset over the rim of the volcano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a beautiful sailaway in venice we traveled to Croatia where our first stop was Dubrovnik.  This is a beautiful small city built into the hills on the coast of the Adriatic.  Our goal for seeing Dubrovnik was to walk the walls of the old city.  The walls are still intact (although patched in places) and provide some pretty amazing views of the harbor as well as the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that all of the homes in the picture have the same red clay tile roofing.  But if you look a bit more closely you will see that some of them are quite new and bright while others are old and moss covered.  Sadly the new tiles vastly outnumber the old, and are an indication that the house was bombed in the war in the 90's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking the wall, which is about 1.2 miles we were a bit thirsty so we found a bar, literally through a hole in the wall.   It was shady and we had a wonderful glass of the local white wine and just enjoyed watching the ocean and chilling out.  As you can see from the picture, the tables and chairs are scattered over the natural rock formation and so the waitstaff had to be quite agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Hole in the Wall Bar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that night we had reservations in Prime C, one of the great specialty restaurants aboard the Journey.  As we were getting ready for dinner we got to enjoy a spectacular sunset  from the comfort of our deck on the back of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Dubrovnik/DubrovnikSunset1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset Spectacular!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had great meals aboard the ship in Aqualina and in Prime C.  Last night was even better as we were able to attend the Chef's table.  Where we had an amazing meal with wines that had been paired with each course by the sommelier.  The menu consisted of Lobster and Avocado Salad with Honig Sauvignon Blanc, Smoked Tomato Veloute with Conundrum White blend, Surf and Turf  Giant Prawn with a Braised Short Rib Croquette) with Schug Pinot Noir, then New Potato Crusted Sea Bass with Lincourt Chardonnay followed by International Cheeses with Toad Hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is was that our reservation to rent a boat to take around the lake on our own was confirmed with Julia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we picked up our little 16 foot boat with a 40HP Honda engine at 11AM and after confirming that I had driven a boat before I was given very brief instructions, the location of life jackets, and off we went.  It was a great way to see part (a very small part in fact) of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cruised by the villa used in James Bond's Casino Royale past the town of Magnerre by many other villas and great lake front property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By design this part of the post-Malta holiday has been to read and relax, so there’s not a huge amount to write about.  But Lake Como is so beautiful that it is worth posting a few pictures from a short hike we did yesterday and some pics of the lake taken from the terrace of our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not in heavy sightseeing mode, just a few hours each day.  The rest of the time we are relaxing and eating and trying some Italian wine.  Thursday we are renting a boat and taking to the water on our own.  It makes me miss my Moomba very bad, but it will be great to get out on the water and view some of the huge villas on the lake from the water side.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="italy"></category></entry><entry><title>saying goodbye to malta</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/saying-goodbye-to-malta.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-06-02:/PelicanBlog/saying-goodbye-to-malta.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Malta/TheseShoes.jpg" width=200 style="float: right;"&gt; These are my shoes.

I bought them for the great adventure of 2015, I started to wear them on January 1 when we left the USA.  According to the health app on my iPhone they now have 647 miles on them.  Much of that has been accumulated during our time in Malta and our travels around the Mediterranean with Angel, Ben, Emma, Erika, Ethan, Jenna, Katie, Meredith, Meredith, Olivia, Rachel, and Tricia, hereafter known as our kids, or our Malta students.  What started out as a funny offhand comment, referring to Jane and I as Mom and Dad has come to feel more true over the few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm starting this post on our penultimate weekend with our group, I am in Rome with Jane and Josh to take in an AS Roma football game tonight.  Some of our students are in Florence for the Nordic choir concert, and some of them are back on Malta (behaving themselves).  Its good to have a bit of physical distance to help put things in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been reading each student's final journal or blog entries, and I must be turning into an old softie (good thing I have the summer to fix that) but I find myself choking up about something that each student has written.  It is true that these past few months of living and traveling together have turned us into an odd sort of family. I'd be happy to adopt them all if I could get that guy in Marrakesh to make good on his offer of 20 camels apiece.  I’ve spent a bit of time lately looking back over all the pictures we have taken.  I put together this &lt;a href="/galleries/MaltaGroups"&gt;gallery of our group photos.&lt;/a&gt;  If you look at the first group photo in Malta and in Rome, and compare that to the last group photo this week, can you see the difference?  Look at the group in front of the pantheon, this group was just getting to know each other, barely acclimated to the Mediterranean time zone.  Now look at the later photos, photographic evidence that we have come together as a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what have I learned about myself this semester?  What are my own conclusions? This heretofore &lt;a href="/posts/01/living-standards.html" title="Living Standards"&gt;unpublished entry&lt;/a&gt; written in Cambodia sheds a bit of light on the recurrent theme of living simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion number one:&lt;/strong&gt;  I can live a more simple lifestyle and live "in the moment".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read over my early posts, and remember back to the end of January when we first arrived on Malta, I am going to admit that the following thought crossed my mind:  Leave this flat NOW, and check-in to the Meridien until it is time to fly home (business class).  I am very glad that I did not do that.  Living in the cold, damp, drafty, loud, and then warm, humid,  dusty, loud, almost-but-not-quite-a-place-I-call-home has been an important experience.  Now that the end is in sight, I am glad that I had the experience of these last four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elves at Amazon.com must be worried about me, as I haven't ordered anything from them since December!  I have lived with the same ten shirts and six pairs of pants for the same period.  Other than going out to eat the material expenditures we have made so far this year are extremely minimal.  OK, I am not totally reformed as I have a new Apple Watch waiting for me back home.  But it was a good experience for me to not consume for a while.  Hopefully this will carry over back home where the temptation of Amazon Prime second day delivery makes the accumulation of stuff all too easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to "live in the moment?"  For me it means accepting life as it happens.  It means taking the time to enjoy each moment as it comes along, rather than always thinking about what is coming next.   Because I have not had daily class responsibilities, I really have been able to live in the moment for most of the last four months.   OK, I am still a worrier; I am always thinking about the worst case scenario, and what to do if said scenario becomes reality.  I am a planner, and a goal setter, I am always thinking about next week, next month, When will my next exam be?  What do I need to do for class next week?  But this semester I haven't really had any of that to think about.  I did worry about some parts of our travel (Morocco, Istanbul...)  But, our evening meals were typically planned at about 15:00 when I walked to Meats and Eats to buy whatever we were going to make for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time during the day was spent walking back and forth to the University.  I have subscribed to several podcasts and am now a regular listener to them.  I've never had time for podcasts before.  I don't know why.   I spent time in class, listening and soaking up lectures on Maltese history and current issues.  I spent time in our flat, and in my office at the IT Faculty building sending countless organizational emails and working on projects and hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion number two:&lt;/strong&gt;  Follow your passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may not be a discovery of the semester, it was certainly a strong affirmation of this oft espoused philosophy.  I like to tell the students in Senior Project that: "If you don't wake up in the morning thinking about what you want to accomplish during the day, you ought to be thinking about finding a new job."  Now, showers aside, I think that every day in Malta I did wake up and have a great excitement about what I wanted to accomplish during the day.  Some days it was the excitement of a field trip, other days it was waking up in Morocco or Istanbul know that a day of discovery was in store, but even on the rainy days of February I had research and thinking to do that was very exciting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact maybe one of the best things about our time on the island was that it gave me &lt;strong&gt;time to think.&lt;/strong&gt;  I spend a lot of time doing back home, and it is hard to carve out time to really step back and rethink things.  Good things happen when you take the time to think instead of do.  I feel like all of the projects I have been working on &lt;a href="http://skulpt.org" title="Skulpt"&gt;Skulpt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org" title="Runestone"&gt;Runestone Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, and the classes I will teach next semester have reaped the benefit of taking time to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion number three:&lt;/strong&gt;  Push yourself outside of your comfort zone, good things will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot about pushing myself beyond my comfort zone in the last six months, but it has been very exciting to see the students do likewise.  They have all grown this semester, becoming more self confident, more self reliant, and maybe more willing to take a risk.  Whether that be jumping off a rock into the Mediterranean, or immersing themselves in other cultures.  For me it may have been simply embracing my part-time role as a student of history and current issues of Malta this semester that pushed me to a new appreciation of history and culture.  It was also surely the experience of living in a flat that is much less luxurious than back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion number four:&lt;/strong&gt;  Be thankful for the people who support you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane and I joke that we are excited to get back home so that we have more adults to talk to.  Not that our students are not adults, but we don't have the same conversations with twenty two year olds as we do with our fifty year old friends.  In some ways this has been a bit of an isolating experience for the two of us.  But we have grown used to it.  The silences are OK, as we know we simply don't have anything else to say at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, through it all Jane has been a fantastic partner in keeping this program working smoothly.  The work she has put in on our travel plans is, extremely detailed, thorough and time consuming.  Planning a trip takes patience and hours of research.  I know I appreciate it and so do the students. It always amazes me when we arrive somewhere and she knows exactly where to go and which direction to turn, while my head is swirling in confusion.  My advice to Ethan and Ben is to follow my lead and "marry above your station."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Corby Preus and Jon Lund in the Center for Global Learning back at Luther for all of their support.  Corby does an amazing job of helping with paperwork, and re-answering my questions about pretty much everything she has already explained to me at least once, and sometimes twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Malta I would like to thank Dr. Emanuel Buttigieg for coordinating the History of Malta course, I know I have learned a lot this semester, and it takes a lot of coordination to organize all of the lecturers from many different departments on campus.  And finally to Rachelle Mifsud for whom there is no request too large or too small for her to help out with.  Scheduling transportation at the last minute, or helping with final exam schedules.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion number five:&lt;/strong&gt;  Focus on the good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a nice one to save for last, and it is a fairly recent conclusion, and clearly one that will take some practice for me.  The last Paideia lecture we did an exercise where we had to think about Malta from the perspective of each of our five senses.  What stands out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sight -- yellow limestone buildings, dog poop on the sidewalk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sound -- honking horns, the "angry" maltese language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smell -- Pizza and the salt air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taste -- Maltese wine, Wild Boar Pasta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;touch -- rough limestone, and cold tile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us commented after class about how negative most of the things we came up with sounded.  Even though the native Maltese professor came up with his own similar list.  Familiarity breeds contempt as the saying goes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the important lesson was summed up by a couple of the students in their own final blog posts in which they said.  "I do not want to remember Malta for the dog poop on the sidewalks or the horns honking outside my bedroom window"  Rather they , and I, will choose to remember Malta for the good stuff: The crystal clear water, the blue waters of the Blue Lagoon, St. Peter's Pool and Golden Bay, the majestic cliffs of Gozo as viewed from the Ocean or the cliffs of Dingli from the land.  The Neolithic temples of Hagar Qim and the mysterious Hypogeum.  The beauty of the Auzure Window.  The brightly colored Maltese boats in Spinola bay.  And, yes, the ever present yellow limestone of Sliema and Valletta. This is the way to remember Malta.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't sweat the small stuff my dad used to tell me.  Let the unpleasant annoying pet peeves fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Goodbye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this will be my final post from Malta, this is not the end of the blog.  In less than a week, the students will be on their way either home or to european travel for part of the summer.  Meanwhile Jane and I will be finishing up our own Mediterranean experience with a few days in Lake Como and then a Cruise from Venice down the Dalmatian Coast and through the Greek Isles, ending in Istanbul.  We planned this as a celebration of the end of our time in Malta, and I'm sure it will be, but right now we are both facing this last part of the journey with mixed emotions.  The call of home is very strong, and I know that if we simply boarded a plane to Minneapolis we would be ecstatic.  But the comfort zone of home will have to wait another twenty days.  Its really not all that much when you consider we have been gone 159 days already, and more adventure awaits us, you can be sure I'll continue to write about it here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="malta"></category><category term="luther"></category></entry><entry><title>cooking in malta</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/cooking-in-malta.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-05-29:/PelicanBlog/cooking-in-malta.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first thing I should say about cooking in Malta is that there are around 600 reasons not to cook within walking distance.

&lt;li&gt;Pepperoncino — The Rosettes (little bowls of pappardelle and proscuitto cooked in cream sauce) are to die for.  Plus a totally small town friendly vibe that you just can’t beat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piccolo Padre   -- Eat pizza right out over the water.  Diavola yum!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wigi’s Kitchen — You can pick your fish or your steak right at the table.  The window seats have an awesome view of Balluta bay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kebabji. -- The students introduced us to this one.  I think of it as "the chipotle of Sliema."  My favorite is Chicken-shish with Tabbouleh, Hummus, Couscous, Harissa, and Sesame sauce.   Actually its the only thing on the menu I've ever ordered, but why mess up a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to divide the rest of this post into three parts, that roughly describe the three stages of cooking I have gone through here.  I call them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsistence cooking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting over it, and getting on with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grilling season arrives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subsistence cooking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/kitchen.jpg" width=400 &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I admit when we first got here, I went through a bit of culture shock.  As I’ve mentioned before, it was colder inside our flat than it was outside, and it was rainy, and dreary most of the time.  Our kitchen was, and still is, tiny and isolated from the rest of the flat.  The cutlery was dull, and the pots and pans old and dented.  We must have set aside 50 knives and a dozen pots and pans from the three flats to be disposed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our first trip to a grocery store called Lidl, a german chain.  All of the ingredients were labelled in anything other than language.  There was little produce or fresh meat, and it was nowhere near our flat.  Next door to us is a small corner market, at the cash register is a young boy who ought to be in school but never is.  They have produce outside, but no fresh meat, and a totally random selection of dry goods.  There is a large supermarket about 1km away, and it has a lot of things.  Going to the Park Towers supermarket for the first time was like an adventure.  Taco shells!  A butcher, a cheese counter with Parmeggiano Reggiano, hot sauce, spices, asian ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/grilledchickenwithfusilli.jpg" width=200 style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"&gt;The first meal we cooked in the flat was a grilled cheese and ham sandwich.  Not regular ham but delicious prosciutto ham, and tomato soup.  Sound familiar?  I’ll bet that is the first thing that many people learn to cook.  I’ll bet it was two weeks before we cooked an evening meal in the flat.  In part because going out for dinner meant that we had some place warm and heated where we could go for a few hours before coming home and huddling under our covers.  The first true good meal I cooked was this pesto with chicken.  We quickly discovered that we don't care too much for pesto in a jar even this close to Italy.   We also learned that vegetables and fruits are much more seasonal here in Malta than in America.  So we had to wait a few weeks before basil came into season to make a good home made pesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="float: clear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting over it, Getting on with it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/carbonara.jpg" width=200 style="float: right;"&gt; Eventually, the temperature warmed up and we got more comfortable with our surroundings and we reached the point where we could not stand to eat out anymore and so we started cooking in the flat more.  One of my goals was to learn at least one new recipe while we were in Malta. I figured it would be so me kind of seafood, but it turns out the Maltese don't really eat that much seafood despite living on an island. After our trip to Rome I realized that what I really wanted to cook was spaghetti carbonara. For some reason I have missed out on this delicious yet simple dish my entire life.   This is one of those simple yet delicious Italian dishes.  Eggs, wine, noodles, cheese, and good cured ham or bacon.  I have been making steady progress on mastering this dish, but I still have a ways to go before it will live up to that first night in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing that made a turnaround in our cooking was learning to shop.  Now there are four places that are worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O'Ryan's on the corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The college street mini market (the green market)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;park towers supermarket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meats and Eats on Dingli &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all the vegetable trucks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dispatch with Park Towers first.  Big, indifferent to rude staff, distant.  Shopped there a couple of times and decided not to go back.  Jane has been back a couple of times to stock up on cleaning and bathroom supplies, but we don't shop there anymore for groceries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corner store is great for water, limoncello, Pringles, and the occasional need for baguette and salami.  It's about double the size of my living room, but packs in all of the essentials including frozen meats.  The owner and his family run it together. Nine times out of ten when you go in there you would think that the mother is on the verge of killing the father or the son. Or it might just be that most Arabic conversations still sound like arguments to my western ears.  Much of the time the cash register is "manned" by a boy who clearly should be in school but is not.  I suppose he will inherit the store and so is learning the trade and the family does not feel the need to send him to school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green market is much larger than the corner store, and has great fresh baked bread every day.  They have a reasonable selection of fruits and vegetables out front, along with canned goods and other essentials.  Most of the time the cash register is manned by an old man who has never once rung up an entire order correctly, but he is charming and friendly every time we go to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/meatseats.jpg" width=200 style="float: left;"&gt;Meats and Eats is probably the single best thing that happened to my cooking during our stay in Malta. The store is bright and clean and staffed by a bunch of friendly Italians.  The meat counter is a joy to visit almost every day.  It's the kind of meat counter wher they have several big hunks of ribeye, originating from around the world, and they Will cut you off a hunk of whatever thickness you like.  They also have marinated pork and chicken and fresh minced beef and pork.  The rest of the store has great gourmet ingredients as well as some nice convince items like prepared curry sauce.  The cheese counter has huge chunks of parmigiana reggiano at a ridiculously low price.  Next to the checkout counter is a wine selection that is just about as good as anything you can find in Malta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that I was going to have a great time shopping at Meats and Eats the morning I decided to give carbonara a try.  I went to the meat counter to get some bacon and had the following conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clint:  Sorry sir, we only have streaky bacon today.&lt;br&gt;
Me: Uhhhhm streaky bacon?  &lt;em&gt;Ahh, the stuff that just looks like regular bacon to my eye.&lt;/em&gt;  What's the difference? 
Clint:   Very thin, not the good cured pork belly.&lt;br&gt;
Me:  Oh,  well I'm just experimenting with carbonara sauce so I think the streaky bacon will work. &lt;br&gt;
Clint:  Oh no sir, you should not do that. If you are doing carbonara you need the good bacon or one of the packages of pancetta in the case over there.&lt;br&gt;
Oh yes, agreed the lady standing next to me at the counter.   Now I am left wondering how I will find this wonderful chunky pancetta back home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/springrolls.jpg" width=200 style="float: right;"&gt;Another thing I'm excited about continuing back home is fried spring rolls!  Jane and I had lessons on making these in Vietnam,  and were excited to try our hand on our own.  When I discovered an Asian market on my walk to school I knew this would become a reality in Malta.  Shopping in the Asian market is like Christmas, I see all of these cool exotic ingredients and I want to get them and try them out.  Fresh lemon grass, six different kinds of fish sauce, Hoisin, Sirachi, you name it.  Now the key to good spring rolls in my opinion starts with the wrapper, and I definitely like the frozen wrappers much better than the dried.  They are easier to work with and I like the texture of the end product better.  With a little more practice I'll be ready to challenge my friend Nancy to a Spring Roll Throwdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/seabass.jpg" width=200 style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"&gt;A Sunday morning expedition to the Marsaxlokk  (Mar-sa-shlock) fish market provided an opportunity to learn how to fillet and cook fresh caught sea bass.  There are many other types of fish available at the market as well, but Jane and I had both watched a you-tube video on filleting sea bass, so that was the direction we went.  The market also has huge king prawns, but taking the head and legs off the prawns is a lot of work for my lunch.  One thing that amazed me about the fish market was that it was not the least bit fishy smelling.  In fact other than the fish market in the middle of Gzira I have yet to walk along the sea here in Malta and think, oh fishy, or ocean.  I guess it goes with the crystal clear water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that we have really had to work on is finding variety in our diet.  Back home we enjoy the cuisine of many different countries all in the same week.  Tex-Mex one night, grilling the next, indian or Thai curry after that, italian, vietnamese, pot roast in the crock pot (an American Tagine),  you name it, we like our variety.  Making tacos is definitely a comfort food that we miss.  The ingredients are just about impossible to find.  Sour Cream and creme fresh are not the same,  The salsa here on the isaland is just not up to par.  Finding taco shells is possible at the Park Towers supermarket, but you have to go there to buy them.  Then there is the beef, or what the British and Maltese call &lt;em&gt;mince&lt;/em&gt;  I suppose that if you look at it objectively &lt;em&gt;mince&lt;/em&gt; is no worse of a word than &lt;em&gt;ground&lt;/em&gt; but having grown up with ground beef,  minced beef sounds a little disgusting to my ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other odd thing is the lack of soups.  You simply cannot buy &lt;strong&gt;cream of mushroom&lt;/strong&gt; anywhere!  So we have gone six months without one of the staple comfort dishes of my entire life, namely beef stroganhoff.  The availability of wonderful Parmiagianno Reggiano makes risotto a good comfort fill in, and here we run into the lack of chicken stock.  I suppose I could, and should, make my own stock but that takes advanced planning.  I'm used to just grabbing a carton of stock from the coop to make my risotto.  Here it appears that boiled water with bullion cubes, or a little container of gelatinous chicken stock substance that you disolve in water takes the place of a good stock.  It does the trick, especially with a little extra Reggiano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally a word about wine.  Maltese wine is surprisingly good, and incredibly cheap.  While many of the students pride themselves on keeping it under 3 euros a bottle, I have found many good wines for under ten.  My favorites are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISIS, a rather unfortunate name for a wine in this day and age, but it really is my favorite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maltese Falcon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marsamena -- a delicious chardonnay from Gozo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of wine I would be totally remiss if I did not mention our local wine shop.  Owned and run by a young man from the south of France, Vini Culture is a fun place to stop in on my way home from school, or to just run  around the corner and grab a bottle for happy hour.  The young guy who runs the store is extremely friendly and pleasant.  I never stop in there without having an enjoyable conversation about wine and France and all the new things he has on order for us to try.  Its hard to understand how he makes a living in a specialty shop like that in the middle of Sliema but I'm happy I got to know him and shop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grilling season&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/MaltaCooking/grillingontheroof.jpg" &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And suddenly grilling season was upon us.   The roof was a much sunnier and less windy place.  The sun was starting to stay out until a reasonable cooking hour.  Meats and Eats has a wonderful pork steak marinated in mediterranean spices, and we can grill that and serve it with some roasted new potatoes from my Sicilian vegetable man.  Some fresh baked bread, and some spinach salad with strawberries and vinaigrette dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sicilian vegetable guy, I have no idea what his name is, is another great story.  Since meats and eats does not sell vegetables, I just walk another half block to this guys fresh vegetable truck.  I know he thinks I'm kind of odd because I usually come in and buy one hot pepper, six small potatoes, or one head of garlic, depending on what I need for the evening meal.  Its not usually much, and it almost always under one euro.
One day I was buying a pepper and an onion for a total of 40 cents, I had forgotten to put change in my pocket before I left the flat.  As I struggled to find some coins and then started to pull out my wallet for a bill he said "listen, don't worry, you can pay me tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grilling season brought with it much more than an opportunity to stand on the roof and cook meat with a drink in my hand.  It brought a huge transformation in the weather, and consequently my enjoyment of our time in Malta.  No longer did I get out of bed in the morning and wrap myself in multiple layers of clothing, no longer were we huddled in the front room, door closed, heater running in order to feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss my Hasty Bake, and its ability to cook and smoke meat slowly, but this little gas powered grill has brought a lot of enjoyment.  Meats and Eats sells Kobe beef patties, as well as Ribeye steak from five different countries, including Australia and Ireland.  It has been fun to try the variety.  They have chicken marinated in three or four different marinades an so that provides us with a great variety of things to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly true that you can learn a lot about a culture by its food.  Malta is definitely no different.  The Italian influence is obvious in the pizza and pasta restaurants that are everywhere.  Their national dish of Pastizzi is not my favorite, but has certainly become a cheap lunchtime staple for many of the students.    The traditional Maltese foods include rabbit, which is also quite good -- especially the rabbit pie at Guze -- and some other stuffed meat dishes.  There are turkish kebab and pizza places everywhere.  We think its an odd combination, and we wonder about all the kebab joints.  I think it must have to do with the influence of the Ottoman empire on the island long ago, but I may be completely wrong.  In general, it is a diet high in carbohydrates, which works for me, but drives Jane crazy.   Jane and I had one of those funny conversations back in January, where the question was if you had to give up variety, and live with one cuisine, which would it be?  Both of us chose Itialian or Vietnamese as our top two.  Then I was leaning toward Italian, but now I am looking forward to more of the fresh healthy variety offered by the Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="cooking"></category><category term="malta"></category></entry><entry><title>unexpected adventures</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/unexpected-adventures.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-05-18:/PelicanBlog/unexpected-adventures.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/taormina_sunrise.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Morning Climb to Castelmola&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the students were planning on sleeping in this morning, Jane and I decided to explore on our own a bit.  High above Taormina sits the little town of Castelmola.  You can't drive there, you have to climb.  And so we did.  But when we arrived …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/taormina_sunrise.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Morning Climb to Castelmola&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the students were planning on sleeping in this morning, Jane and I decided to explore on our own a bit.  High above Taormina sits the little town of Castelmola.  You can't drive there, you have to climb.  And so we did.  But when we arrived in the little town we were rewarded with a spectacular view up and down the Ionian coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id="castelmola-caption" class="center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/holy_cannoli.jpg" width=150 style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"&gt;After enjoying the view we decided that a Cannoli and Cafe were in order before we started the hike down.  At the end of one small street we found the perfect place.  Maria, the proprietor of Gallo Cedro was cutting tomatoes on the terrace.  "Prego," she said by way of invitation to come in and sit down.  The Cannoli's were first rate.  She stuffed them fresh for us and added some chocolate chips and pistachios to top off each end.  Perfecto.  We were about half done with the Cannolis when she unexpectedly appeared with two shot glasses and a bottle of almond wine.  Well it was only 10AM, but we figured when in Sicily...  So we had a little digestif to help the cannolis go down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gole Alcantara&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the Lemon Tree (the name of our apartments) around 11 and everyone was out of bed and getting themselves awake for the day.  We had some discussion about what we might do this afternoon.  The gorge, known as Gole Alcantara, sounded like an interesting short hike and there was enthusiasm among the group for a stop at a Sicilian winery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way to Gole Alcantara and after making a donation to the parking attendant we set out on our short walk down to the gorge.  It was beautiful.  Of course many of our "kids" wanted nothing more than to play in the water which was quite a problem  since we had not brought beach towels or anything for them to dry off with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/gole_alcantara.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enjoyed the area, we checked our email to see if we would be able to visit any of the wineries.  Unfortunately none of them could accommodate us that afternoon.  So...  We decided that we could do our own wine tasting back at the Lemon Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Red and White&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wine tasting preparation required another stop at the supermarket where we put a strict limit on the price of wine to be purchased for the tasting. Our goal was to keep it under 100 euros while recognizing that with 13 people each of us would just get a taste of each different bottle.  It was quite the production to get six of us to agree on what wine to select.  I will say that the Italian construction workers who were supposed to be building another set of shelves in the middle of the aisle we fairly amused/distracted by the blonde haired blue eyed wine aficionados. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/wine_shoppers.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were in the wine aisle another group was in charge of meat and cheese and fruit.  As you can see we put out a pretty good spread.  We also agreed that we were "in for the night" as there was no way we were going to drive our mini-vans down or up the winding hill to the Lemon Tree after wine tasting activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/wine_tasting_setup.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wine and cheese went remarkably quickly.  Even with a seventh inning swimming stretch between the reds and the whites.   I guess it was inevitable that after a bit of wine, some of the people were going to end up in the pool fully clothed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the reds, gone, people were in the mood for movies or whatever, and then "the munchies" set in.  We had been told that there was at least one Pizzeria that would deliver all the way up the hill, and that Paula would take care of calling and ordering for us.  After much trying however it was determined that the pizza places were closed on Monday night.  The horror and sorrow of a hungry group of students without pizza.  We were totally resigned to a pizza free night when Paula knocked on our door to inform me that the pizzas had arrived!  We were saved.  And for some reason she was convinced that the students needed a nightcap, and so brought them a complementary bottle of home made limoncello!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="luther"></category><category term="sicily"></category></entry><entry><title>climbing mount etna</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/climbing-mount-etna.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-05-17:/PelicanBlog/climbing-mount-etna.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/lemontree_view.jpg" width=300 style="float:right"&gt; The van arrived right on schedule, 4:45 AM, and we were all in the courtyard in front of the flat on Triq  DePiro ready to go.

This is our last group trip together with the Malta students, Spring 2015 edition.  It is a bonus trip in the sense that because Jane saved us a bunch of money by doing so much planning for our trips to Rome, Morocco, and Istanbul,  that we were able to afford the plane tickets and lodging to get everyone to Sicily.  Of course with budget travel comes early morning flights, but nobdy seemed to mind very much.  We were, after all, heading for Sicily.  What nobody guessed was that we have a distinctly non-budget view from our lodgings for the next three nights!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight to Catania is ridiculously short is is just over 100 miles and takes less than 30 minutes, we barely got above 11,000 feet before we started our descent.  Our departure time was so early that once we arrived in Catania we had a good hour to wait before the rental car agencies opened up.  Yes, we are driving in Sicily.  Its part of the plan to keep costs low for this trip.  Two mini vans for the group.  The plan for the day was to meander our way north to Taormina stopping along the way at Bronte to sample some Pistachios and at Randazzo to check out lava as a building material in a Medieval town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the day was to do some hiking on Mount Etna.  It is amazing that there is still snow on the volcano in mid-May and even more so when you consider that the volcano is &lt;a href="http://rt.com/news/228691-etna-lava-eruption-volcano"&gt;quite active&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out together as a group and enjoyed the break from the busy urban vibe of our home in Sliema, stopping for a group photo in this cool clump of trees:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="group" src="/images/Sicily/luthertree.jpg"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the group splintered with varying degrees of adventurousness, and an unfortunate bruised thigh for Jane due to a loose rock.  Some of us persevered up the side of the volcano until the winds became so strong we thought we would blow away.  Climbing through the lava is a lot like climbing up a giant sand dune.  It is very hard work.  It also reminded us of the scenes of Frodo and Sam climbing into Mordor in Return of the King.  As we were scrambling our way up, a helicopter flew overhead and hovered over us for a few minutes.  I think we all expected to hear a loud voice tell us to turn around and get out of there, but I guess they decided we were harmless and not in harms way as it soon moved on.  After we reached our goal we were tired and happy to be there if only for a few minutes to enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Sicily/summit_down.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
If you look close, you can see part of the group on the plateau in the middle right of the picture.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we began to descend our shoes soon became filled with sharp little pieces of lava.  This made the descent quite painful and necessitated a few stops to empty the shoes.  At one point I was really glad Emma was standing behind me as she remarked.  "I wonder who's glasses these are?"  Of course they were mine having just fallen out of my pocket as I was emptying my shoes.  That would have been a loss, and impossible to find one pair of transition lenses hiding in miles of black rock.&lt;/p&gt;

After a bit of a mixup on the bus this morning, we got to spend 4 amazing hours with Captain Franz on a boat trip from St. Paul’s bay to Gozo to Comino.  Complete with caves, and cliffs, and swimming.  Click on the thumbnail below to see the photo gallery for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus mixup is amusing now that I look at it a day later…  We had arranged for van to pick us up at 9:00 to bring us up to St. Paul’s bay.  But after waiting and waiting I finally connected with my contact, Rachelle, at the University who handles all our transportation scheduling for us.  It turned out the bus company had screwed up the schedule for the day.  The solution was to send a coach. The only other vehicle available and in the area. No, not one with horses, a giant bus.  Wait by the corner we were told.  Oooops  wrong corner.  More delay.  Imagine the 14 of us on a coach that could easily hold 60 people.    So we made it to St. Paul’s in Style and in the end were only about 35 minutes late. Thankfully Frans was a very patient captain, and it was no problem  to extend our time in the afternoon to make up for our lateness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="malta"></category></entry><entry><title>a tale of two scams: in three parts</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-tale-of-two-scams.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-05-03:/PelicanBlog/a-tale-of-two-scams.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Gastronomic Negotiation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sir, you walk past me &lt;strong&gt;every night.&lt;/strong&gt; Please give me a chance!  I will give you an appetizer and  free baklava for desert!"  &lt;em&gt;Really?  I honestly don't remember you.  I've only walked down this road one other time.&lt;/em&gt;  "Very Sorry" I say, "I've already got a dinner reservation back at Ocean's 7. "  "you will like it!" Says one of the patrons at the current establishment.  Another ten steps down the road and we are implored to "Look at my menu."  A bit further on we are told  "Sir, I have your table ready for you!" The idea that you can bargain for your supper seems so counter productive to me that I just cannot fathom it.  Hey, lets see how little I can pay for something I'm about to ingest into my body.  The incentives here are all in the wrong direction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine the conversations in the kitchen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waiter:&lt;/em&gt;   One chicken and rice for the cheapskates at table five!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chef:&lt;/em&gt;  Oh great, now we know what to do with the gizzard and thigh meat that has been sitting on the floor all night! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Thank You&lt;/strong&gt;  I will be more than happy to pay a price that puts the chef on my side.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waiter:&lt;/em&gt;  Chef the generous folks are back at table seven.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chef:&lt;/em&gt;  Great, tell them to order the veal, I've got two extra tender pieces I've been saving for my best customers.  Oh, and bring up that 2011 Rombaur Chardonnay from the cellar, I know they will love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can all agree on which chef we would rather have cooking our food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole hawking the restaurant thing has been an ongoing saga since we arrived in Istanbul, and we even experienced it in London a couple of weekends ago.  I don't remember it being the case in Vietnam or Morocco, and certainly not in Malta,  but maybe this has more to do with the onset of high touring season than our location.   Now, this is not really a scam  (although we have heard stories of the old bait and switch ) so much as an intro to  the two things that happened to us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cruising on a Reputable Ferry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan for the day was to take the Ferry up the Bosphorus river to the mouth of the Black Sea.  You get to see a lot of Istanbul along the way, then the ferry stops for a couple of hours so you can have lunch or do a little hiking and then comes back.  As usual Jane had it all planned out, including a discount for using our museum passes.  When we arrived at the waterfront we were immediately accosted by the usual crowd of tour people trying to sell us one of their packages.  -- two hour boat trips, three hour boat trips, six hour boat trips...  "No, we are going on the ferry!" we would say.  "But I can leave sooner.  I will take you to the same place, wait for two hours and bring you back.  My boat holds 80, it will be much nicer than the ferry and 800 people!"  Hmmm, we were intrigued, and a bit horrified that we were even considering this option.  But after a bit of negotiation, and multiple confirmations about our destination and pricing we decided to risk it.  The captain even threw in a 50% discount on coffee at the nearby snack shack.  Run by a relative no doubt.  "Just wait here" we were told.  So we waited and watched them try to work their magic on other passersby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, one of them came up to talk to us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot take you.  I cannot do the trip for just your group.  It will be better if you take the ferry, down there.  There are not enough passengers today, because the bike race is keeping them all away from here.  I am sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was true, there was a big Tour of Istanbul bike race in town, and the weather was a bit dreary, so the pier was sparsely populated.  Which also meant that the ferry was not nearly as crowded as Jane's research had led us to believe it would be.  So, we carried on with our original plan, got our tickets to the ferry and were on our way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruise was interesting, we got to see some castles, and some amazing real estate.  And even a container ship that originated from Valletta!  We just can't get away from Malta now.  Here is a little slideshow of some photos on the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The shoeshine redemption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the cruise we had to make our way back into the spice market to buy some of the delicious candy covered "fistik."  That is peanuts covered in a syrup and rolled in sesame seeds.  We discovered these our last day in Morocco, and were only too happy to find out you can buy them in Turkey as well.  Some of the group wanted to hit the archeological museum while others just wanted to wander the spice market some more.  So we turned them loose and decided to wander our own way back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were passing up one street that was very lightly travelled a shoe shine man dropped his brush in front of us.  So, we picked it up and called out to him to give it back.  He thanked us and we were on our way.  Suddenly he called back to us.  He sat down and and said "please,"  with a look that said let me repay your kindness.   We thought how nice, one good turn deserves another.  But I had on my hiking shoes, which are not "shineable" and so he offered to shine Jane's black shoes which were definitely in need of some love after all of our travels.  He finished up Jane's shoes and then insisted on brushing mine with a toothbrush and some water -- which certainly did not hurt.  About this time both Jane and I reached into our pockets for a few coins to tip the guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise when Jane offered him several one lyra coins and he said "no, paper"  What?  He doesn't want coins he wants paper money?  Slowly it dawned on me that we had been played this whole time.  He now wanted to be paid the full amount for two shoe shines, which took less than a couple of minutes.  I added my coins to Jane's and dumped them in his hand and we turned and walked away.  I guess we both got half price shoe shines, and nine turkish lyra (about $3).  Lesson learned, and a small price to pay for a story to add to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>istanbul: capital of two empires</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/istanbul-capital-of-two-empires.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-05-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-05-02:/PelicanBlog/istanbul-capital-of-two-empires.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"You want a fish!?"

"No,"  I said, "do you have a cork-screw?"  doing my best imitation of screwing in a corkscrew and then pulling out the cork.  "Ah!  One moment"  And off he went, out the front door and into the restaurant across the street.  Moments later he was back with an excellent corkscrew, which I used to uncork the bottle we had purchased around the corner and then returned to him.   After I got back to the room I could not contain my laughter any more.  A fish?  The fact that he borrowed the corkscrew from the restaurant, which was the very thing that Jane had suggested in the first place.  An idea that I soundly rejected.  Hi, I know that we didn't eat dinner here or buy anything from you but would you mind terribly if I borrowed your corkscrew to open the bottle of wine I bought at the market around the corner?   I just can't imagine myself saything those words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/sultansroom.jpg" width=230 style="float: right;"&gt;  A glass of wine was a great way to cap off what had been a very full day of touring around the old city of Istanbul.  Once known as Constantinople, it was the head of the Christian world.  Then under the Ottoman empire it became a Muslim country.  Today, Turkey is largly muslim, but the government is a secular government.  We began with a tour of Topkapi Palace were we visited the treasury, and the Harem and saw the Sultans private rooms.  We also visited the tulip gardens.  It is an interesting fact that although Holland is usually celebrated for its tulips, the Dutch took them and transplated the tulips from Istanbul originally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tulips" src="/images/Istanbul/tulips.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hall of mirrors, I told students about recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/recursion.jpg" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did not care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/bluemosque.jpg" width=230 style="float: left;"&gt;  From the Palace we moved on to the Blue Mosque, one of the icons of Istanbul.  There was a really long line to get in, but we made the best of it, while Ben ran into someone with nearly the same last name as him in line.  He turned out to be from wisconsin, and has relatives in Decorah.  Small world.  The line was rather entertaining, as standing in line appears to be optional for many tourists here in Istanbul.  However all of the guides team up to try and send the line jumpers to the end.  It is interesting to see the reaction of the people who clearly know they are being jerks and getting called out for it.  Once we got inside it was amazing.  It is so hard to describe this space, like St. Peters in Rome it is just so large that you cannot hope to capture the scale of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/bluemosquedome.jpg" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/hagiasophiadome.jpg" width=180 style="float: left;"&gt; Across a very large square from the Blue Mosque is Hagia Sofia.  This was once the largest Christian church in the world.  Of course it was later supplanted by St. Peters and others.  The really interesting thing about Hagia Sofia is that it was converted to a Mosque.  &lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/asymmetric_apse.jpg" width=230 style="float: right;"&gt; Check out the apse of the church in this next picture.  Notice that the alcove is not centered.  This is because even though the church was sited east to west, the axis was just eleven degrees off of the line to Mecca.  Because Muslims do not allow for images in their mosques all of the mosaics were covered in whitewash and then painted over in more typical muslim designs.  Except for the Seraphim.   Look at the two images below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/seraphim_m.jpg" width=300 style="float: left;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Istanbul/seraphim_c.jpg" width=300 style="float: right;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the only difference here is that the face was painted over with a symetric diamond shape.  Some of the mosaics that they have begun to uncover and restore are really stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hagia Sophia" src="/images/Istanbul/sophiamosaic_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we visited the cistern under the basilica.  You may remember this from James Bond, "To Russia with Love."  It is just this giant underground place that used to provide water to the city.  But now, it is just stunning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Cistern" src="/images/Istanbul/cistern.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of that we headed back to the hotel for a short rest before we took the students out for a group dinner.  We were all plenty exhausted after such an interesting day.  Tomorrow, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Market, and Taksim square.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="istanbul"></category><category term="turkey"></category></entry><entry><title>biking in london</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/biking-in-london.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-04-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-04-21:/PelicanBlog/biking-in-london.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Think you have done it all in London?

Here is a great way to spend a day, for almost no money. Rent a Barclay's bike and head for the Regents Canal.  This is exactly what we did and it was a fantastic way to enjoy London away from the traffic and the museums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll discover a whole different culture and way of life when you bike along the canal.  There are hundreds of narrow small barges that people live on or work the canal on.  We saw all walks of life that appeared to be barge owners, from the very wealthy to those who reminded us of the people in Veitnam who lived on their boats with no heat or running water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path is fairly narrow, so you have to be alert or you could get wet, which would definitely spoil an otherwise good day.   Also you need to remember that pedestrians have the right of way, so just be polite, use your little bell, and don't go too fast!   We didn't have any trouble, and we enjoyed all of the scenery and the side trips that are available from the canal path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day one we started from Angel, and followed the path toward the London Docklands.  It was warm and scenic, and gave us a great taste of barge life on the canal.  We wandered around the (free) docklands museum, hoping to learn a bit more about the canals, but were disappointed.  The docklands museum is actually a very interesting history of London, so that was not disappointing, just that the museum didn't have anything to say about the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day two we went the other way, and ended up having lunch in the rather bohemian Camden Market area.  We also took a side trip around the zoo and the royal gardens to see some incredible villas that have been built right along the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love London.  It is probably my favorite big city in the world. I think I have visited at least six times.  So I have done the museums and most of the good tourist attractions.   My top five  would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Transportation Museum in Covent Garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The science museum in Kensington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Imperial War Museum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our visit to Parliament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a really great alternative way to spend the better part of two days enjoying London culture from the perspective of a cyclist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus part of this post, I do have to admit that I had never done the London Eye until this visit. It was definitely a fun way to get a view of the city.  Jane and I both did a little bit of experimenting with time lapse videos on our iPhones.  I wish I had brought my tripod so I could have captured the entire circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting tickets to the FA cup game is no easy trick.  All of the tickets allocated to both clubs (Arsenal and Reading) were sold out to season ticket holders well in advance, so visitors like us are left trying to buy tickets online from third parties at crazy high prices.  Yes, its crazy to pay over $300 to go to a soccer match.  Yes, I paid it willingly!  We  did some research, so we think this is a reputable source of tickets but you have to put a certain amount of trust in strangers in order to get your tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the train ride into Farringdon station we walk over to the apartment we had rented through AirBnB, another exercise in trusting strangers, and are rewarded with exactly the fantastic two bedroom apartment we were promised.  The owner met us at the door and showed us around.  He had purchased us some breakfast items, and some fruit, and a nice bottle of wine.  The apartment is on a Kings Mews street, which is nice and quiet so no problem with street noise either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and Josh arrived a few minutes later with Jim's luggage.  We got a two bedroom so we could share with Jim and so he would not have to spend the entire long weekend in Josh's student housing.  Which after seeing it, I am glad we did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 11:00 came and went, we still had no tickets.  So we were preparing ourselves for the worst, which is really not too bad considering our apartment has a 56 inch big screen for the backup plan.  We were all a bit nervous, but found some good entertainment value in the chat that Josh had been having with customer support at the ticket agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:35:25): How can I help you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:35:29): hi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:35:45): Hi Tina, we spoke earlier today about my order #XXXXXX. The tickets still haven't arrived yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:37:07): I know - i have been told by Jamie that the tickets will arrive at your house by 11am in the morning as he have to do lots of deliveries and was promised by him they will be with you at 11 at latest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:37:16): please accept my deepest apologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:37:36): 11am? This is now the fourth promise made by your company to me in the past two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:37:40): This is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:46:05): Thanks for your assistance on that. I know it's not your duty, and I am clearly angry, but I will not subject you to that anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:46:24): A refundable situation sir is where you did not get your goods as ordered and in time to watch the match&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:46:39): but once again it is not my decision as you understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:46:56): I know that that's a full refund, but I think the stress caused here warrants a special situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:47:11): But yes, I won't take it up with you! My mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:52:29): I don't think so. I'm sorry you've had to deal with me today (and plenty others like me I'm sure!) during this busy day. I know you're trying your best, but like I said earlier, my family flew in for this match and would ruin their holiday if this falls through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:52:54): sir - I must say that you are one of the most kindest people I spoke to in this chat support ever!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:53:17): Haha well I'm glad to hear that. I'm sure customer service can be very testing at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:53:40): you are very polite and kind despite being angry and dissapointed but you never had it on me at any point of our conversation and I thank you for that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMS (23:54:26): Well I'm glad it has been a (relatively) positive experience. Hopefully I won't have to chat anyone at your business tomorrow at 11:15! Good night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:54:49): I hope that the only chat you will have tomorrow is to say that you have got the tickets as ordered sir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cust Serv (23:55:03): good night sir- sweet dreams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet dreams indeed!  By 9:00 the next morning, we got the good news that we had tickets in hand.  The problem was that  they were not in the category we had paid for.  They were not bad tickets!  In fact they were really good.  Row 8 on the first level, but they were in the corner so we would be looking at the field the long way.  Since the website said tickets were fully refundable if you did not receive tickets in the category you paid for you were eligible for a full refund.  So we got online and complained a bit.  The first response was that we had been upgraded, and that these were actually better tickets than we had ordered &lt;strong&gt;for this game&lt;/strong&gt;.   LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this conversation we received a call saying that they had tickets for us in the area we had ordered.  However these were way up in the nosebleed area, and we would be split two and two.  about this same time we also noticed that two of our tickets had post-it notes attached with the note that they were Junior tickets.   Hmmm, maybe we got the wrong tickets?  Maybe they need to swap with us to get these to some guy and his two kids.   Well, we reasoned, we don't have to meet this guy and get the other tickets, possession is 90% of the law.  So we began to think about breakfast.  But before we all met up for breakfast,  we got an email from Karen, who had been woken up at 3AM back in the US by a call from Thomas, who wanted us to call him on his mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that Thomas also had tickets, but said they  were "VIP tickets."  Karmic payback for being "one of the kindest people I spoke to in this chat support ever"?    Maybe!  Two of these new tickets included access to a table in the Bobby Moore hospitality area (free pre-game meal and drinks), and two of them were "merely" on the Wembly Gold (free budweiser at halftime) level.   So, in less than 12 hours we had gone from zero tickets to tickets that were beyond anything we could have imagined.  These tickets would be delivered to us by another delivery person, and then we were to meet Thomas near Wembly to return the four we originally had received.  The new courier arrived at our apartment in a shiny white Range Rover, and delivered our packets of tickets.  They all looked legit, and we all had great seats right on the halfway line!   Now all we had to do was find Thomas and hand over the old tickets.  Those young children might get to see the game with their dad yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we made the walk from the Wembley tube station towards the stadium we had many opportunities to sell our four extras.  We thought that we might even make a profit, but our honesty and the fact that we had VIP tickets in hand, put us in the mood to  carry on to our meeting point and keep up our end of the bargain.  It is interesting to think about the business model and operations of a third party ticket seller.  They are selling the tickets to us at a significant markup, but the tickets have to come from somewhere.  So they have to be able to forecast in advance how many tickets from each area they will probably have, and then they need to get those tickets from the original owners to the new buyers.  Its no wonder a lot of the transactions come down to the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tickets allowed us into the stadium well in advance of the game so we had plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere and check out all of our food, beverage and gift shop options.  As we were standing in the gift shop I saw one young man in Reading blue from head to toe, with a big foam blue finger call out to his dad.  His voice was shaking with excitement as his big blue finger pointed to a rack of merchandise.  LIVERPOOL he said with longing.  The dad just melted into the ground.  I guess you can't control who your kids will choose for their football team, even in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of the Men in Blazers show, I was very excited to see that meat pies were available everywhere in the stadium.  Tom's pies to be exact.  So I enjoyed a very nice Guinness and roast beef pie as a pre-game meal.  It is true, they are quite good.  flakey crust, stringy tender roast beef and gravy on the inside, just like Sunday dinner back home.  So, here is the obligatory food shot!  You might also notice the betting sheet on the left side of the photo.  You can bet on almost anything right there at the game.  Final score, who will score, when will they score, who will score first, etc.  It was too complicated for us so we left the betting up to others and saved our money for sausages and more food later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="beef pie" src="/images/London/meatpie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game itself turned out to be good.  It wasn't Arsenal's best performance of the year.  But I blame that on Wenger for going away from the lineup that had us winning nine in a row.  I would not have substituted Welbeck for Giroud, but I am not the manager.   Nevertheless Alexis scored a great goal just before halftime and I was feeling good.  A strong pep talk in the locker room and surely we would come out and seal the game with a couple more goals.  It turned out that the opposite happened.  Reading came out fired up and scored an equalizer, and we looked like we were playing "not to lose"  which is our worst strategy.   At the end of regulation it was Arsenal 1 - 1 Reading.   OVERTIME!  We were really getting our moneys worth out of these great seats.  As long as we win in overtime and don't go to penalties life is good  Which is what happened.  shortly before the end of the first extra period Alexis scored again.  It was kind of a sad screw up for the Reading keeper, but a victory is a victory!&lt;/p&gt;

Its not surprising as it has been a busy and amazing two weeks, full of new cultures and new experiences.    &lt;img src="/images/Spain/malagahotelview.jpg" width="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"&gt; But, this morning we have time to just relax, watch the sea outside our room, and think about our experiences over the last three months.  In total we will be gone for 179 days!  That is a long time to be away from family and friends and the comforts of home.  But the time has gone by quickly, and will only accelerate as we head towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a few minutes this morning to put together this map.  The red pins show everywhere we have been since January 1, 2015 and the green pins show all the places we have yet to visit before we arrive back home on June 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=zDurv3BVrWLs.kUgsYjsWuIQA" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do I take away from this journey so far?  I would like to break it up into three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expanse of history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The variety of culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The challenges of living away from home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never would have guessed that a new understanding and appreciation for world history would have been one of my biggest takeaways from this experience, but it is certainly shaping up to be that way.  A big reason for this has been  the history course at the University of Malta, and seeing the evidence of history everywhere you turn.  You go to Valletta and you can't escape seeing the walls and the buildings left behind by the Knights of St. John's.  You visit other places and see the Megalithic temples or evidence of the Romans or Phonecians or the  Ottoman Empire.  But what is really cool is that now when we leave Malta I have a much better appreciation for the timescale and the artifacts left behind by these same people in other parts of the Mediterranean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of the Roman empire is simply amazing.  As we were standing among the Roman ruins in Volubilis Morocco, we could just as easily have been standing in Ostia Antica in Italy.  The frescos on the floor looked the same, the aqueducts and walls were identical to those we have seen in Italy, France, and Spain.  Now we flew, on a jet, and drove in a fast car to all of these places.  Its really hard to imagine how an empire like this managed when the way to travel was on horse, or foot, or camel.  There was no internet to get word back to headquarters so its easy to imagine that important information would be lost or take many months to get from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/BradJane/halongbay.jpg" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"&gt; In Malta, the arabic influence is clearly heard in the language, but not so much in the architecture.  However  now that we have traveled to Morocco and Spain it  is interesting to see the influences of the Ottoman empire in both places.  It is also interesting to see how all of the different empires recycled and reused materials from their predecessors.  Mosques built from the stones of Christian churches and vice versa.  Churches that still bear signs of a mosque built from stones taken from a prehistoric temple.  I am really excited to visit Istanbul in a few weeks to see this city where Islaam and Christianity have coexisted for so many centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that I have developed a better appreciation for the timescale of history.  When we hear that at one time Malta was predominantly Muslim, but now Christian, or that the Berbers of Morocco were predominantly Jewish but are now Muslim you wonder how did that happen?  Slowly.  These are changes that took place over hundreds of years.  Longer than the United States has been a country!  Back home we might say, look at this old building, it has been around since 1849.  That is barely a blip in the timescale of the history here in the Mediterranean.  At the same time, I have developed a new appreciation for the importance of preserving our own historical artifacts for future generations to study and learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cultural Variety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on internet time, it is easy to think that everything and everyone has always changed as fast as it does today.  But, it is easy to see that this is not true.  In the pueblos blancos of Spain, the towns of Malta, and the villages of Vietnam and Cambodia, things don't move so fast.  People still fix their old televisions and home appliances rather than just toss them aside after five years.  In the medinas of Morocco and the villages of the Mekong delta people still use every part of every animal and plant.  Husks of rice kernels are used to fire the kilns for making bricks, every part of the cow or goat or camel is used for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to observe the old men in the different places that we visit.  They are the same everywhere! If I was a better photographer I would ask their permission so that I could take their pictures and share them.  On my walk to the University in Malta ther are three guys that sit on the sidewalk every morning, talking and arguing and solving the worlds problems.  In Spain we saw them in the small towns, having coffee when we would stop for our own mid-morning break from cycling.  Having a coffee, and talking, arguing, and solving the worlds problems. In Morocco they gather for their tea and they talk and they argue and they solve the worlds problems.  They supervise local construction projects everywhere. It is the same in Decorah as well: at the Back Home bakery, or the Oneota country club, or happy hour at Rubaiyat. In Decorah, I know the names of most of the men, and am slowly beginning to join their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/BradJane/morocco.jpg" width="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"&gt; Morocco was my first experience in traveling in a predominantly Muslim country.  Vietnam and Cambodia are predominantly Buddhist.  Malta is strongly Christian.  Of course there are big differences in all of these religions, but the main thing that strikes me is that the people who practice any of these religions have much more in common than you might think.  Of course, as our Moroccan guide noted, there are crazy Christians and crazy Muslims and crazy Jews who cause trouble, but the non-crazy people want to live good, healthy, peaceful lives.  People of all faiths love their children and their neighbors and want to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about religion,  you can't ignore Football (soccer).  Soccer is another great unifier of people.  If you are a soccer fan, you can find a friend almost anywhere.  We have enjoyed watching the English Premier League in every country we have visited.  Of course in Spain it was a bit more of a challenge as La Liga dominates here.  But we have always been able to find a pub that carries the game.  People everywhere know Arsenal and Manchester United.  More importantly, they love to talk about their local team.   I love to ask the waiters or the porters  in the hotels if they are soccer fans and who they support.  They are always a bit surprised to find an American that is an avid futball fan.   Is soccer really growing in America? How did you become a fan?  What will happen with the MLS? Are you happy that Steven Gerrard is joining the LA Galaxy?  How many years will it be until the USA dominates in the world cup?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Living away from home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we left home in January Jane and I talked about how this would be a great experiment.  Would we be ready to be snowbirds?  Would we miss our friends too much to leave Decorah for six months?  What would it be like to make friends in a totally different culture?  It turns out that this was a flawed experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have settled in to a flat in Malta its hard to compare this to what it would be like to have our own place in California or Arizona.  Although the flat is perfectly livable it is not ours, it is not even something that we would choose if given the chance to look around.  And, because we do not own the place and are only there for five months, we can't really change it.  No painting, no updating, so Nespresso coffee maker.  So we live with what we have, which is very different from how we would do things if it were our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for my own research work.  It has been nice to have some time to really sit back and think about the direction my research and work on &lt;a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org"&gt;Runestone Interactive&lt;/a&gt; will need to take over the next few years.  I have learned that I am far from ready to retire or give up the exciting work that I do on this project and with students at Luther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/BradJane/azurewindow.jpg" width="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"&gt; The people we have met in Malta are very nice, but we have not made new friends.  Building relationships takes time and investment, and it is hard for others to invest when our time in Malta is so short.  It is hard for us to invest when our time is short. It makes us think about being more welcoming and open to new friends back home.  It is easy to settle in to the same comfortable group of friends week after week.  It is much harder to break out and invite new people into the circle.  Mike and Shirley do a much better job of that than anyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have settled in to a routine that largely centers around the students and ourselves.  Occasionally  we have gone out with another couple, but this is fairly rare.  We have Skyped or Facetimed with our friends and family back home and have really enjoyed those times as much as anything.  Technology is a wonderful way to connect.  All of those Jetsons cartoons I watched where they  used the video phone have come true.  So, although we have always valued our friends, we have learned how important those friendships are on a much deeper level than we knew before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/BradJane/desertsunset.jpg" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"&gt; Although we have traveled many thousands of miles, and logged many nights in hotels and restaurants, it is important to stop and realize that this journey has been an inward journey as well.  I am thankful for the growth and learning that this experience has brought so far, and I eagerly await the new experiences yet to come.  As we prepare to pack up and head to the airport this afternoon, I find that I cannot say we are going home.  Home will come soon, we will be home when we are back in Decorah and with friends and family on
 Bone Lake.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>andalusia biking summary</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/anadalusia-biking-summary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-04-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2015-04-10:/PelicanBlog/anadalusia-biking-summary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm just going to put all of the images into a big slideshow for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Malaga to Antequera:  Tonight we stayed at the Convento Magadaleno after a very difficult ride through the Sierra del Torcal.  24 miles in the heat and a lot of climbing.  We checked in to the convent, and then used the spa.  Dinner was outside in one of the small hill towns close to the convent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El-Chorro to Ronda   Through the Sierra de las Neives.  We had seen El-Chorro from the train on the way to Malaga and were excited to bike here.  It is beautiful.  The afternoon climb was a bit much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ronda - out and back to Grazalema  -- Jane stayed in Ronda to explore while I went out for the day.  The ride to Grazalema was great, and the hill town was cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olive trees in Granada:  Tonight we moved to the Barcelo La Bobadilla.  A wonderful five star hotel, with great restaurants and a good spa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunch in Iznajar:  We skipped the crazy hard climb to start out the day, and coasted downhill instead.  However since all hill towns are at the top of hills we still had a climb to finish off our riding and get a well deserved lunch in this cool town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resting in Malaga&lt;/li&gt;

Whereas Morocco was a bit of a mental and cultural challenge the biking is definitely a physical challenge!  On day one we covered 24 miles and climbed 4,400 feet.  On day two 27 miles and 6,600 feet.  That is definitely a PR for me in terms of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sitting in the hotel room this morning with mixed emotions.  Its quite windy and cool outside this morning and I'm thinking of all of the climbing ahead of me, and my legs are a  bit on the worn out side.  On the other hand, we have seen some great scenery, this is really beautiful country.  Jane made her decision yesterday, she is getting a massage, she is going shopping, she is pretty smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Spain/grazelema.jpg" width=200 style="float: left;"&gt; Fast forward to 5:00 I am back from biking, my legs are tired another 24 miles, not so much elevation today, only 3,500 feet.  But I don't mind, my legs are tired.   Did I already mention that?  Today I rode with Flynn, he is a young Australian, and an avid rock climber as well as cyclist.  On our way out to Grazelema  for lunch, we stopped at a hiking trail with a nice overlook of an ancient dam.  The dam is very interesting as it was built in the early 19th century by workers working round the clock eight hour shifts.  However after the dam was finished they discovered that they had used the wrong kind of stone, and it leaked badly.  They were never able to repair the dam and make it usable for generating electricity, and so it was abandoned without ever being used.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dam" src="/images/Spain/day3dam.jpg"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At lunch we decided that exploring around the dam would be a good diversion.  Especially if we could walk out on top of it!  So we rode the van back to the hiking area and started our way down.  We were rewarded with some pretty spectacular views.  As usual, its the unplanned side-trips that turn out to be the most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src="/galleries/Spain/biking2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;img src= "/galleries/Spain/biking3.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize the trip to date, we have had some great food and stayed at some wonderful hotels.  Our first night was in an old convent  - convento magdalena -- in the Andalusian countryside.  nestled in between the mountain peaks it was very secluded and a great place to start our rest and relaxation.  The picture below shows the clouds spilling over the mountain.  They would come across the top and fall down into the valley, then they would rise up again and disappear before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="clouds" src="/images/Spain/magdelenaclouds.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 brought us to the town of Ronda where we are spending two nights at the hotel Reina Victoria.  It is obviously a popular biking stop as groups from Trek and Backroads are also staying here.  The hotel has a nice spa, and we have a fabulous view out the window of our room.  The view is because we are at the edge of town and right on the edge of a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ronda" src="/images/Spain/rondacliff.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronda is a fascinating little town.  A medieval village with Phoenician, Roman, and Arab walls.  The whole town is on top of a highly defensible outcropping of rock.  You would have to go steeply uphill, or straight up a cliff from almost any direction in order to attack the town.  Ronda is divided into the old part which has the traditional "pueblos blancos"  and the new part.  The two halves are joined by the "new bridge" built in the seventeenth century.  It is quite a marvel of engineering for that day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, I have nine more like her!  I'll be back later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shook hands laughing and parted ways.  Such is the life in the Marrakech markets.  For the record, I'm just kidding Angel, Jenna, Meredith, Meredith, Tricia, Rachel, Erika, Olivia, Katie and Emma!  I would hold out for at least thirty camels a piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Marrakech/groupgarden.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The women are worth 200 camels, I don't know what I'll do with the guys.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joking aside, traveling with 10 &amp;quot;daughters.&amp;quot; did present a few challenges.   Before we left, we had discussed with the students that Morocco has not come as far in the area of Women's rights as the United States and many other european countries.  This was hammered home for us as we drove into Marrakech and our guide told us breathlessly that in Marrakech we would see something new and very different...  (long pause) Women on motor scooters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left we told our &amp;quot;daughters&amp;quot; that it was important to adopt a more conservative style of dress for this trip.  Cover your shoulders, no tank-tops and no short-shorts we said.  And they all followed this, although next time I would explicitly add running tights to my list of items to not wear.  We heard a few mutters from our students as we saw female tourists from other countries in revealing outfits.  Nevertheless, our daughters stuck out, the long blond hair, and blue eyes (and, unfortunately, the running tights) were a real attraction for many of the local young men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that sixteen year old boys are idiots no matter where you are in the world.   One night a group of boys followed five of the daughters back from a restaurant.  Although they said they were not in danger, it was definitely an uncomfortable situation for them to be ogled and followed down the narrow dark streets of the medina  by this small group.  Other times we all heard the whistles or moans and comments from men of all ages as the group walked by.   When you walked in the back of the group it was painfully obvious to watch the heads turn and stare as the group went by.  I'm hoping that some of them will write about this from their own perspective in their journals or blogs and that we can have further conversation about this back in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is our last day of traveling with the students for the Malta Easter break.  Tomorrow we go our separate directions.  The students to Amsterdam, Belgium, Germany, England, Greece and the Czek Republic.  Jane and I to southern Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been an amazing trip, Morocco is surprisingly beautiful at every turn.  We have learned a lot about this country, its history, its culture and its people.  The people are cheerful, and as you can see from the exchange above they have a great sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is that sense of humor more evident than in the Souks, the great marketplace of Marrakech.  They say that you haven't been to Marrakech if you haven't gotten lost in the Souks.  So, we did.  There are thousands and thousands of small shops, all arranged in a twisty maze seemingly designed to draw you deeper and deeper so that you have to pass by even more shops to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are leather shops, wool and agave silk dyeing shops, wood shops, copper and silver shops, shops with tagines of all shapes and sizes.  Nothing has a price on it of course, which is what makes the whole thing such an adventure.  You have to be careful about even looking too hard at anything or the shop keeper will come up to you and draw you into the store, if you ask the price, you must be prepared for something beyond anything you are willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were offered &amp;quot;student prices,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;democratic prices,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;special price for friends from America prices,&amp;quot; and more.  Its all part of the game.  leather bags and purses that started out at over one thousand durhams could be had for 250 to 500, depending on their quality and the willingness of the bargainer to simply walk out of the shop and leave the poor shopkeeper looking sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;We were coached:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I make you a price now you make me a price.
What if I don't want this?
Its ok, we will still be friends.  Now make me a price.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jane came back with an offer that was too low on a purse the shopkeeper was deeply hurt and began to put all of the stuffing back in the purse.  &amp;quot;For that you can buy a camel purse.&amp;quot;  A few moments later when one of our students volunteered her to come up 50 durham (about $5), the sale was cheerfully closed, and we were all friends again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had demonstrations of quality.  Lighters held up to leather, &amp;quot;if this was camel leather it would burst into flames, but this is good cow leather.&amp;quot;  fingers were licked and run across the died leather, to demonstrate that the color did not in fact come off when the leather got wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another seminar on spices and their medicinal properties of varous spices and aphrodesiac properties of various herbs.  &amp;quot;Except for you,&amp;quot; she said to one of the young men in our group.  &amp;quot;You don't need this!&amp;quot;  This time the seminar ended with extra large shopping baskets being passed out to everyone.  Then she started over going through each item again with a chance to purchase.  I have a nice package of Nigella seeds that will clear my nose and help my asthma. In addition to some nice Morrocan curry and Harissa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Marrakech/spicerack.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane and I are now in the Marrakech airport.  The students are safely on their way, and we have a little longer to wait before we can check in and make our way through security.  From here we will travel to Seville then Malaga where we will meet our guides for our bike trip for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

At dinner last night we decided to stick around town this morning and visit the Ksar (fortified city).  At breakfast, Mohammed, the owner of the Hotel Bagdhad Cafe was happy to line up a guide, also named Mohammed, for us at the last minute, giving him an unconditional recommendation as the best guide in town.  As it turns out he may very well be. Mohammed is part of one of eight families that still live in Ksir Ait Ben Haddou, a very old city that is also featured in several movies including Jewel of the Nile and Gladiator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/BenHaddou/BenHaddou.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The houses in the Ksar are made of big clay and straw bricks for the very practical reason that they keep the temperature down to a comfortable level even when the outside temperature reaches 49 degrees C.  Remember to convert that to F you double it which is already a warm 98 degrees, but then add 32!  The Ksar is built into the side of a steep hill, so as we went up from the lower part of the town to the upper the views became more spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/BenHaddou/rivercrossing.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about the midway point of our climb our guide stopped outside his own house.  &amp;quot;You are welcome here&amp;quot; he said.  This is a phrase we have heard everywhere in Morocco from many different people.  It is a phrase that our guide has said to us as we enter each new city we are stopping in. It is a phrase I've been thinking about all day.  It has a much different feel than &amp;quot;welcome to Fez.&amp;quot;  it is at once more personal, more authentic, and in a place where we wondered whether we really would be welcome it is is quite comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a stop at a local artists studio where he was painting with indigo, Saffron, and &amp;quot;berber whiskey&amp;quot;  the green mint tea that you get everywhere in Morocco.  The interesting thing about the tea is that it is when you paint with it it acts like invisible ink.  You can't see it until you heat it up.  So he paints the picture and it looks like there are pieces missing until he holds the picture over the flame and reveals the finished work.  At only $5.00 a painting many in our group bought a picture to remember this part of the trip by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the tour we came upon a mosque which is still in daily use.  Right next to the mosque was a synagogue, no longer in use.  The history of the Berber people is very old, and interesting.  At one time the majority of the Berber's were Jewish, then for a time the majority were Christian, but now they have been Muslim for a long time.  We've heard a similar story about the Maltese, although they are now Christian.  This change in religiion does not happen over night, of course, it happens over generations.  The result for the Berbers is that they are peaceful, and very tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/BenHaddou/bhviewwide.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to get along with all people our guide told us.  He went on, the problems in the world today are caused by three things:  money, politics, and crazy people -- Crazy Jews, Crazy Muslims, and Crazy Christians.  Most people are good and peaceful people, its a shame the crazy people have to ruin it.  Thats a pretty succinct way of summing up the state of things in the world.  It was also an echo to commnents made by a previous guide about &amp;quot;idiots in Iraq&amp;quot; destroying relics of their own ancient heritage.  Clearly no one religion has cornered the market on crazy people. It seems that during our travels those we have met have gone out of their way to emphasize that most Muslims are peace loving people that don't have any ill will towards us.  I think its the same for me.  I'm embarrassed by the crazy Christians as much as they are embarrassed by the crazy Mulsims. The more important question is what to do about the crazies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our travels this year we have encountered amazing people of all faiths, Buddhists in Vietnam, and Cambodia, Muslims in Morocco, and Christians in Rome and Malta.  It is these people that have made the past months memorable.  On this Easter weekend, it is a bit strange to be in a Muslim country knowing the Easter celebrations going on back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish all of our friends and neighbors far and wide Peace, and a blessed Easter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Camel noses!&amp;quot; came the answer from the back of our mini-bus. The question was &amp;quot;what is one memory or thought you would take away from yesterday?&amp;quot;  Other thoughts about yesterday  centered around the bookends of sunrise and sunset,  changes in geography, the orange of the dunes against the blue sky, the beauty of the desert sunset, and the awesomeness of being present in the place and the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  This is an expanded version of a post that I wrote for Luther's Ideas and Creations blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Desert/oasis.jpg" style="width: 200px" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where were we?  We began our day watching the sunrise on the rooftop terrace of our Riad in the ancient city of Fez Morocco.  From there we travelled through the Middle Atlas Mountains with stops for a snowball fight and monkey feeding.  We descended from the mountains into the plains where we travelled through towns abandoned with the overland spice trade.  Ultimately, the plains turn to desert with high plateaus.  We experienced the wonder of coming around a bend and seeing a valley oasis, full of Date Palms. We ended our day about 35 kilometers from the Algerian border, at a desert camp site watching the sun set over the Moroccan desert.  It was quite a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived just after 6pm at the auberge where we met our guides for the night.  We tied up our turbans and mounted our camels.  This was a new experience for all but one of our group.  As we rode out of the hotel area and into the dunes, each camel got a name.   We also learned that camels are not the most comfortable beasts to ride.  But it was fun, and a great shared learning experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the students shared a sentiment along the lines of &amp;quot;Holy Crap!  How did I get so lucky to be here on a sand dune in the middle of the desert?&amp;quot;  If you haven't experienced the quiet beauty of desert sand dunes you should add it to your bucket list.  As one member of the group said, &amp;quot;it is just sand, but it is really beautiful.&amp;quot;  For me, the word that has stuck in my head throughout our time here in Morocco has been authentic.  The leather tanneries of Fez are not selling mass produced goods.  The marketplace is a real working marketplace.  The dunes are not arranged for our viewing pleasure. You will find no dune gardeners out there arranging things and picking up the trash.  The wind and the sand take care of the cleaning.  Last night's footprints were erased by the breeze that came up early this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Desert/desertsunset.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Desert sunset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enjoying the sunset at the top of one of the taller (160 feet) dunes, we came down to our little nomadic camp in the valley where our guides, four young men, served us tea.  We talked with them a bit about how the recent attack in Tunisia has had very negative impact on tourism in Morocco.   It is sad for them, as this is such a  beautiful country, and we have felt safe and warmly welcomed almost everywhere.  At length, tea was followed by a Moroccan meal.  There was a rice salad with tuna and tomato, onion, peppers and oranges.  followed by a tagine filled with potatoes, carrots, and beef.  For desert, oranges and apples.  After cleaning up a bit our guides returned with traditional African drums and played and sang for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Desert/bradjanesunset.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Jane and I in the setting sun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no distractions from this group experience as we had no cell service and no WiFi.  They sang some traditional Moroccan songs for us.  All of them were Muslim, and at least two of them came from Berber backgrounds.   There was a bit of dancing by Jenna and Angel, and drum lessons for a few.   When they finished they asked us to sing for them.  It was a little bit sad how hard we had to struggle to think of a song everyone knew.  The nostalgic part of me thinks that could be because we need more nights of face to face entertainment, and fewer with WiFi.  The other parts of me are happy to be writing this post on my iPad knowing I can upload it and all the pictures from almost anywhere else.  In the end, Ethan, Ben, and I were the brave one's and we gave our best rendition of  the college hymn, &amp;quot;To Luther.&amp;quot;   A bit later the appropriate beat inspired a rousing rendition of &amp;quot;We Will Rock You&amp;quot;  with Ben taking the lead and showing  a part of himself that I hadn't seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Desert/luther.jpg" style="width: 200px" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, when I got to the top of the dune to watch the sun rise, I found a water bottle left over from a previous group.  The wind had blown the sand over and around the bottle leaving a very interesting pattern on the leeward side.   A miniature example of the sand dunes and the desert as a whole.  I don't know what the last two days will mean for the students in the long run.  I don't even know how today's experience will shape my own future.  But I know it will, as each past travel adventure has left its mark.  It strikes me that the  bottle and the dunes are a great metaphor for study abroad and Lutheran higher education.  We can lecture for hours, and give them days of homework,  but it is these experiences that will shape our students in ways we cannot possibly imagine or plan.&lt;/p&gt;

The Minarets have just become active as the call to prayer begins from every direction.   I'm trying my best to write down my thoughts now because I'm so overloaded after the day we have just had I want to record my reactions now rather than tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we smelled and tasted 20 different spices in the spice market,  tasted four different kinds of Moroccan flat bread,  half a dozen different kinds of dates,  more olives than I've eaten in my life,  Chickpeas with cumin and chile,  a dozen different kinds of honey, each with its own medicinal purpose, tea made of mint and absynthe, Fava bean soup,  and beef cheeks and tongue.  We visited a bakery that bakes everything from bread to stuffed spleen.  In the words of one particular Gozotan guide, I must say this was the best marketplace tour ever.    The market just seems to go on forever in every possible direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very interesting, and slightly uncomfortable in the  places that we ate.  These are very small stalls in the marketplace and in several cases the owner literally kicked out other customers to make room for our entire group.  To help you imagine the size of the place I am writing about, imagine a king size bed.  On three sides of the bed you have walls going to the ceiling,  Leave about a foot between your imaginary walls and a table in the middle of the space.  Now take 14 people and get them around the three sides.  In every case one or more Moroccans were sent next door in order to make room for all of us to eat together.  They didn't seem to mind, as they seemed happy to observe us and to share their food and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets are narrow, no cars are allowed in the Medina, but donkeys and handcarts are!  We learned some new words Ballack!  Get out of the way.  That is especially important when the donkeys laden with gas tanks are coming by.  Or when the garbage donkeys are hauling out the trash.     Also:  Yellah, follow me, Shukran, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Fez/donkeygas.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Make way for the donkeys&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass of people was quite overwhelming for me, shouldering my way through the crowds has never been high on my list.  Navigating through streets that are sometimes barely wide enough for one person to walk on, brings it to a whole new level.   But, the people here have welcomed us very warmly.  They are eager to share their culture and city with us even though we blonde haired blue eyed Lutherans stand out like crazy amongst the many other colors of this melting pot city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smells also had a huge effect on me.  From the pungent spices, to the citrus smells, to the produce (in all stages of freshness) to the various different meats being cooked and/or butchered.    Every time you turn a corner you are subjected to / assaulted with a new smell.    Perhaps the best of this was at the spice market.  The proprietor gave us a 45 minute seminar on spices and all of their medicinal purposes.  The highlight was when he had us all sniff black anise powder.  WOW, in terms of a sinus clearing activity you just can't beat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Fez/spiceman.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The spice man giving us a seminar on spices and their medicinal properties&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morocco is primarily a Muslim country, although they pride themselves on being quite progressive and peaceful.  One of the most profound moments of the day came as we were visiting a madrasa.  Our guide, Achmed was telling us about the training they receive and the importance of incorporating science into their training.  In addition to memorizing the Koran having a sound understanding of science is an important part of religious training.  In a way, Morocco is the cradle of much of science.  When Europe was in the dark ages, scientific studies flourished in Morocco.  In a world where many in our own country are all too quick to call climate change a theory, or evolution a fiction, it is fascinating to hear what an integral part of religious training science is in Muslim world.  This is especially interesting when those same people are all too quick to paint all Muslims with the same brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Fez/madrasagroup.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The group in the madrasa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our tour, we all did our best to be good ambassadors for the United States, Luther College, and ourselves.  This meant dressing a bit more conservatively than some would normally do.  It means being polite and greeting strangers in the market with a smile.  It means respecting people and not taking their picture without getting permission first.  Its amazing how such simple things can pave the way to better relationships with the people you meet.&lt;/p&gt;

From the way our neighbors fly down the road, to the fact that nobody uses turn signals (actually that is the same practice as back home) to the fact that it appears to be impossible to find a parking spot in our neighborhood it just didn't seem worth the trouble.  We can walk to almost everything we need, and with some patience take the bus almost anywhere else.  However, when one of our students sprained her ankle and we discovered just how long it was going to take her to bus to school, we decided to give driving a shot.  It was especially easy when we found out we could rent one for about $5.00 a day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Malta/driver_jane.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Our Chevy Spark.  Not as big as a Volt. (or a Vespa)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an experiment that has been modestly successful, but one that we'll be glad to see the back side of in a week.  Yes, it is nerve wracking, yes, parking is a pain, and yes, people just honk their horns for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Really dude behind me?  Don't you think I would get out of your way if I could?  But there are 20 cars stopped in front of me and nobody is going anywhere so just calm the heck down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side the car has allowed us to enjoy the island in ways that would have required hours of painful bus riding, and that is what I would really like to highlight in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="dingli-cliffs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dingli Cliffs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first outing in the car was to the Dingli Cliffs.  As spectacular as they are from the shore, we can't wait for warmer weather so that we can experience the cliffs from the water side.  You just don't get the scale from pictures but these cliffs are 250 meters.  Straight down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Malta/dingli_panorama.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Dingli Cliffs.  Yes, thats me.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in the morning, just after the rain had stopped.  So although we knew we were in the right place we were well ahead of the rest of the tourists and hikers for the day.  After a couple of long dead ends that led to some nice scenery, we hit the jackpot and were rewarded with some spectacular views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hiking the cliffs, we continued south to check out the Blue Grotto. Again, a bit of hiking away from the normal tourist crowd left us alone with plenty of time to just take in the sites.  We had yet to actually find the Blue Grotto, but after we returned to the car, we were informed by the local captain that he was the parking lot guard for the day.  He said this as he extended his hand with palm up, ready to accept a euro coin from us.  We were not sure exactly what his duties were, but he told us where we should go to get a good view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Malta/DSC01747.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Blue Grotto with the small island of Filfla in the background.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little island in the picture is called Filfla and it looks like an aircraft carrier.  So it was used for target practice by the British air force during world war II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="golden-bay"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Golden Bay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another weekend, and another short car trip.  Remember that Malta is only 122 Square Miles.  So we never have that far to drive.  This time toward the Northwest side of the island where there are a series of bays, the most famous of which is called Golden Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m10!1m8!1m3!1d12922.867375123567!2d14.34252!3d35.9294303!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1426599232753" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bay actually called Ghajn Tuffieha, was the site of the incident with the sprained ankle.  All I can say is that after seeing the place in person, I'm glad they called the ambulance.  I can't imagine trying to carry a person with a sprained ankle across the rocks, then the beach, then up all of those stairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was great and the scenery was spectacular.  We just walked slowly and took in all of the great sights.  In the distance we could see the sheer cliffs of the southwest side of Gozo.  The water is so unbelievably clear that you can see the bottom of this bay from the top of the cliffs.  Its not terribly deep but at least 12 meters we are told.  Now that is some visibility.  It definitely motivates us to want to dust off our SCUBA diving skills again before we leave the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="marsaxlokk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marsaxlokk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last Sunday we took a morning drive to Marsaxlokk (pron. Marsa-Schlock). This is a smallish fishing town at the very south of the island.  On Sunday mornings they have a great farmers market with fresh produce and tons of fresh seafood.  We ended up at a stall where the lady was nice enough to educate us a bit about finding fresh fish.  I was pretty sure she was being truthful with us as there was a chef from a restaurant also at the table getting fish for his restaurant.  Clear eyes, red gills.  The clear eyes thing is a bit subjective, but the Sea Bass we bought was Amazing.   After a couple of youtube videos on how to fillet the thing (thankfully our fishmonger gutted it for us) we had some nice fillets for Sunday lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nice looking fish market on the way home from the university that I will not hesitate to try in the near future.  I think some nice King Prawns and risotto is on the way to our table soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we go from here with respect to the car is an unknown.  It goes back next Monday, and I think Jane and I will both breathe a sigh of relief.  Although once we get back from spring break we will not have too many weekends left on the island, I think we may take advantage of a one or two day rental to continue to get out of Sliema and enjoy the open spaces of Malta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

All this talk of using EU funds to build a bride, doesn't seem that far fetched.  One hop to Comino, another to Gozo. Nevertheless the short ferry ride gives you time to anticipate the day ahead.  After weeks of cool and rain we had a fantastic weather day to visit the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying out the &lt;em&gt;GeoTag Photos&lt;/em&gt; app for the trip, that would use the gps in my iPhone to track our movement around the island.  Later you upload the gps data and sync it with your photos.  Since my camera doesn't have a built in GPS, this works well for adding location data to your photos.  It worked great, and you can even use the data you capture to build a map of your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Gozo/gozogps.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hired a van and a guide for this day because we wanted to cover a lot of ground.  You can get everywhere on public buses but you end up spending half your day waiting around bus stops.  It is also a law on Malta that at many of the outdoor attractions groups of 10 or more must be accompanied by a licensed guide.  So, our guide, Joseph, met us at the ferry terminal on Gozo and we were off on our whirlwind tour.  Now you may think that this was quite a marathon day but you have to know that Gozo is only 8.7 miles long and 4.5 miles wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Ramla bay, a red-sand beach and lots of green space.  Yes, glorious, fabulous, wide open space free from limestone buildings and paved roads.  Over the course of the day it became very clear to me that this is exactly what I have been missing, and I'm really coming to understand that although there are things I like about the city I am really a small town guy at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time of watching the students cavorting on the beach we moved on to Calypso cave, where we had a great view of the underwater sea wall built by the Knights of St. John as part of the islands protection against the Turks.  You can see the wall, closer to shore than you might think pretty clearly in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Gozo/Calypso_Cave.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A great day out of the city!  Enjoying the green and some nice weather.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the bay we headed to the Megalithic temples at Ġgantija that date to Neolithic times.  We had heard a lot about these temples in our History lecture and so it was great to visit and see these massive structures first hand. They truly are massive.  There are some hints about how the giant slabs were moved around, in that they have hundreds of stone balls that have been discovered.  The theory is that the balls were used like bearings and the slabs were rolled on top of the balls.  Pretty clever for 5000BC if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the temples we made short stop at the salt flats in Marsalforn.  It was only a five minute stop but is definitely on the list to return to.  I managed to purchase a bag of sea salt from the guy who owns the salt flats, and so I should be set with some great salt for cooking the rest of our time here in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was a stop in Victoria for a quick slice of pizza as we walked to the Citadel.  Today was really about great outdoor scenery, but I include one shot of the citadel.  Bonus points to anyone who can spot the problem in this photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the day was the Azure Window.  This is nearly iconic place for Malta, and it certainly lives up to all expectations.  What I wasn't expecting was the awesome little boat ride from the inland sea to the Azure Window.  You start out in this little bit of inland water, and the boat takes you through a tunnel out into the mediterranean sea, into a few caves and finally under the big arch that forms the window.  It was so beautiful and I can't wait to get back to Gozo again to visit this place.  You could easily spend half a day hiking around and on top of the arch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final stop, and another highlight is the town of Xlendi (pronounced shlendee).  The first thing I said to our guide was that I felt like I had just driven into Cinque Terre, and he agreed.  This is a beautiful blue bay, with lots of space for hiking and enjoying the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there were a lot of places that needed more time, the trip was a real success in that we got a great taste of all the places we want to revisit.&lt;/p&gt;

In the last week we've had four lectures involving geology, geography, and archeology here in Malta.  All of them have been fascinating along multiple dimensions.  It has been such a positive part of our Malta experience that I wanted to write my thoughts down right away.  To give you a clue where this ultimately rather long post is going let me tell you what I find so interesting up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observing some really good professors do their thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting to be a student again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning how other fields do problem solving as good as CS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding what the phrase &amp;quot;learning in place&amp;quot; is all about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, its been really fun for me as a professor to observe other professors doing their thing.  I know that we are really privileged to be getting some of the best in their field to speak to us.  But they are all really passionate about their topics and it is amazing to me how that passion comes through.  I honestly walked out of today's lecture with Professor Vella and said to Jane: &amp;quot;I want to be an archeologist when I grow up.&amp;quot;  She may or may not have said that &amp;quot;I would never grow up,&amp;quot; so there was nothing to worry about.  Then one of the students mentioned something about archeologists living in tents for long periods of time and that further tempered my enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Malta/Malta_04_Hypogeum_Hal_Saflieni.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Hypogeum Ħal Saflieni (Malta), the sanctuary chamber Holy of Holies Hypogeum Ħal Saflieni (Malta) built 6,000 years ago.  Image &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogeum_of_Ħal-Saflieni#mediaviewer/File:Malta_04_Hypogeum_Hal_Saflieni.jpg"&gt;CC-by-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, its really nice to attend class as a student.  I'm sitting in on our History course called &amp;quot;Malta and the Maltese -- A Historical and Cultural Review,&amp;quot; and of course I'm attending our Paideia II course on &amp;quot;Ethics and Current issues in Malta.&amp;quot; I have to evaluate the student for this one.  Most of the content of the courses I'm attending, I know absolutely nothing about.  But I can't even tell you the number of times during our lectures that I've had that little tingle of excitement at the base of my neck.  I feel like the poster child for &amp;quot;lifelong learning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, in my own myopic way, I assumed that computer science, and some of the other sciences had a monopoly on problem solving.  It turns out that archeologists solve some pretty interesting problems too.  And they use some of the same techniques as the computer scientists.  Or maybe its the other way around.  To be fair the closest I've come to an archeology class is Indiana Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course problem solving starts with a problem or a question, such as: How do we know that the so called megalithic temples  were really temples?  Why is metal better than stone?  What can we learn from contents of the cargo hold of the Ulu Burun? As our lecturer said, I have a colleague who knows everything there is to know about this pot, its chemical composition, every marking and scratch.  Meh.  Who used this pot?  What did they use it for?  Who did they use it with?  These are the important questions.  Now the chemical composition may be important in helping us answer those questions.  But we cannot stop with that.  In fact it was chemical analysis that showed that of the four sites where obsidian could have come to Malta only two of the sites matched the chemical fingerprints of the obsidian on Malta. Which tells us more about who the people were that were coming to the island at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Malta/Tarxien_Temples.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Tarxien Temples are examples of Megalithic structures which are among the oldest in the world.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our history class we have heard much about the importance of Malta through the ages because of its location on the routes into and out of the Mediterranean.  For the most part people have assumed that ancient sailors tacked their way through the Straight of Malta against the prevailing winds.  It turns out that would not work well at all.  In fact ancient square rigged sailboats could not even tack that way!  So sailors probably made for Sicily, then south and around the island of Malta and maybe even further south around Lampadusa and then worked their way west.  But you have to know a bit about sailing and ancient boat design in order to figure this out.  I love how this incorporates techniques from lots of different branches of the academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, The faculty of Luther College received an email from our assistant dean, Jeff Wilkerson, the other day inviting us to a discussion about &amp;quot;learning in-place.&amp;quot;  I will have to respectfully decline, but I think that is exactly what we are doing here in Malta!  There is something really compelling about our lectures when everything we are talking about is within about an hours drive on public transportation.  We can learn some theory about the Megalithic Temples, and now I'm much more interested in taking the time to actually go see them.  It feels like the entire island is our classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday on the news we hear about the migrant crisis in Malta and Italy.  People from Syria and Somalia are fleeing their countries in fear of their lives.  They are coming by the hundreds of thousands and overloading the ability of the Italian and Maltese governments to handle them.  We have seen why this cannot be an easy decision for them, as many of the people who flee across the mediterranean in these boats die in the process.  Three evenings a week, our students come face to face with people who have made this journey and survived.  Most are the same age as our students.  Only the young and strong can survive the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about that.  How many of our Luther Students have truly had to risk their lives.  How many of us in the Luther community even understand what it means to live under the threat of death?  This is one part of living abroad that makes me very grateful for the security, relative safety, and freedom we have in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our students travel to the Hal Far detention center to work with the residents who want to learn english or to improve their english skills, so that they can leave the Hal Far center, find a job, and ultimately apply for citizenship somewhere in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/Malta/My_Pet_Peeve.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A personal pet peeve of mine.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one more example, that I find particularly interesting because it gets at one of my pet peeves about where we live in Malta.  In a lecture on sustainability we were told that because of their colonial past the primary moral frame of reference for the Maltese is the &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; not the &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;.  This is interesting, especially for those of us who think that community is a nearly sacred word on the Luther campus.  But what does it mean to have a moral frame of reference centered around family?  Do we see evidence that it is true?  We are told that because the moral frame of reference is the family and not the community there is not a highly developed sense of citizenship or emphasis on &amp;quot;the greater good&amp;quot; here in Malta.  We see this in the streets every day in the form of litter, and even worse dog poo casually left on the sidewalk by all sorts of people.  People take very good care of their homes on the inside, but the public areas of the city are not treated with respect.  One has to get used to looking up and down as you walk on the narrow sidewalks here.  Down for the aforementioned reason, and up, because in many places there are drain pipes from overhanging decks that drain the water onto your head!  We see further evidence of this idea as we hear about the myriad of government programs that are started, but never fully supported by the people, and therefore abandoned.  On the flip side of this, the Maltese people are justifiably very proud of their country and its amazing history.  We've been told more than once that most Maltese think their country is the best thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'm still a newcomer here, and I'm not a social scientist, so I may be interpreting things all wrong. If I am, then I would be happy to have further conversation to understand better.  For example, some of the issues in Sliema may simply be due to the large number of international people who are living here either on holiday, or as long term residents. I also know that I am generalizing, which is always dangerous.  Just like any place I know there are Maltese who do not litter and care deeply for the environment, and work tirelessly to improve the island.  I'm sure there are people who pick up after their dogs. Although I'm less sure about the latter than the former.  There are lots of people who volunteer their time through NGOs.  I'm sure it takes years to leave the laissez-faire attitude in the past.  After all, Malta only gained independence in 1964, and statehood in 1974.  After thousands of years of being conquered by almost everyone else, 50 years of self rule is hardly any time at all.  I can imagine that after an entire history of being ruled by others, it would be easy to let external things slide and to focus inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could travel forward in time a thousand years to see what the archeologists of 4015 have to say about Malta in 2015.  In the meantime, I know that I will enjoy the next three months and all that I will learn in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

Watching Arsenal, keeping up with The Big Bang Theory, The Blacklist, Food Network, and a few others.  How you do this is well covered territory.  You can probably figure it out with several google searches,  but it seems worth it to collect my own efforts into one cohesive post.  Here are the problems to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to stream TV shows that have geographic restrictions.  Lots of content is available only inside the borders of the USA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get the content off of your small screen and onto a larger screen if you are lucky enough to have one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to optimize your WiFi and streaming throughput in the midst of an urban WiFi jungle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning.  This is a geeky technical post.  You can quit here and I won't feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="streaming"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of options for streaming from places like Hulu, Netflix, and even the big four major networks all have apps now that let you stream more or less of their content.  When we left home, I had NBCSportsLive Extra, Netflix, HBO Go, DirectTV all installed on my iPad.  I also have iTunes, and had downloaded a few movies that I had on my list to watch.  In the United States this would be fine, but all of these apps (except iTunes) have geographic restrictions on them.  So I also had to subscribe to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service and configure that on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="vpn"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VPN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with a VPN you can think of it as a bit of software that messes around with your network configuration to make the rest of your computer and the rest of the world think that you are a part of some other network.  This is often used in large organizations where you have content that you restrict to your own institutional network.  Luther does this with some resources, like our network drives.  Other services, such as O'Reilly's Safari, may check to make sure that you are coming from a particular network before you are granted access to their own content because of a corporate licensing agreement.  If you have a VPN connection back to your institutional network then it is just like you are in the office and not at home or halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the reason this is important for my entertainment is that there are many VPN services that exist partly for the purpose of making it look like you are connected to a network in the United States somewhere rather than a network in Vietnam or Malta.  I signed up with &lt;a href="http://www.privteinternetaccess.com"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt; These services also have the side effect that your content is encrypted from the time it leaves your computer until it leaves the VPN provider, which many people look at as a significant privacy benefit.  Using a VPN to trick NBC into thinking that I am in the united states might be considered a moral gray area, but I'm still paying my DirecTV, and Mediacom bill every month back home every month so I don't have any problem going to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VPN solution works pretty well, except for some content providers have figured out how to identify these VPN servers, and have made moves to block the connections from known VPN providers.  I'm looking at you ABC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This content blocking thing is interesting, especially from companies like ABC that force you to watch commercials as part of their streamed offering.  Why wouldn't they want more eyeballs on their commercials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="to-the-big-screen"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To the Big Screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got settled in our flat in Malta, I decided I wanted to upgrade the streaming experience by adding an AppleTV to the TV in our flat.  With this setup, I can use Airplay to send the content from my iPad to the larger screen we had set up in our living area.  Except that it doesn't work.  The AppleTV has no provision for joining a VPN.  There are some ugly hacks that involve jailbreaking your AppleTV but I didn't want to go there.  I'd rather install more iPad apps for streaming FoodTV, Fox Sports, and several others that I've added to the list since we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our Entertainment center in our flat in Sliema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Malta/entertain.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;section id="dns"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Domain Name Service is at the heart of the Internet.  If you haven't been subjected to my days of DNS in Networking class, you can think of it like a phone book for the entire world.  Of course its way more fun and complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does DNS have to do with this particular problem?  Well, when you want to contact a website or stream some video, you need to look up the address of the server that authenticates you, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; checks to see that that address is in the right country.  You find the address by contacting your friendly local DNS server.  You normally don't have to worry about this because your home router takes care of it.  But, it is an easy thing to customize.  It turns out that these video streaming services use one server for authentication, and a different server for video streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With me so far?  Now there are companies that provide DNS services to replace the DNS provided by your friendly neighborhood Internet Service Provider.  For example Google runs DNS servers that you can use.  They are really reliable, and of course keep track of all the addresses you look up to better inform their search algorithms I suppose.  However, if google wasn't trustworthy, you could ask them for the address of company X, and they could lie to you so you connected to company Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid a full VPN, and to make it easier for helping iPads, iPhones, and AppleTVs get around the geographical restrictions there are some companies that are running their own DNS servers that will in fact lie to you about the server you connect to for the authentication part of setting up a video stream. This little setup is actually called a &lt;strong&gt;proxy.&lt;/strong&gt;  So when you ask for the address of the ABC authentication server you don't connect to ABC you connect to one of the servers run by &lt;a href="http://www.unotelly.com"&gt;UnoTelly&lt;/a&gt;.  UnoTelly sits between you and the authentication server and passes on your information.  But since the UnoTelly server is in the United State, ABC thinks you are in the United States too.  With the authentication taken care of UnoTelly gets out of the way and allows your AppleTV to connect directly to the streaming server.  So far the UnoTelly servers remain blissfully below the radar of content providers everywhere.  Yay technology.  Also, DNS is very easy to customize even on your AppleTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a silly arms race between the VPN Providers, the DNS providers, and the content providers.  Hopefully this will sort itself out in a saner fashion sometime soon.  In the meantime its likely that every time the content providers find one way to block some clever software engineer will figure out a way around the block.  It reminds of of disk copy protection software in my younger days.  No matter what scheme a software company came up with to block copying, someone would figure out a way around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="optimizing-your-streaming"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optimizing your Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to our final problem.  How to optimize your streaming in the WiFi jungle.  The flat we live in is in a very densely populated area. My WiFi Scanner program shows between 15 and 20 different access points depending on the time of day and day of the week.  With this many access points there is a lot of interference because everyone is trying to use a rather narrow band of the radio spectrum at the same time.  Although WiFi is divided up into 11 different channels, there are really only 3 of the channels that don't overlap and interfere with nearby channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the best solution is actually to use wired internet if you can.  luckily my AppleTV and my Router sit right next to each other, so its easy to plug in.  Even when I am using Airplay from my iPad to send something to the AppleTV the stream ends up coming directly through the wire rather than over WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't plug in, then you might think that the thing to do is to choose a channel that isn't being used by one of your neighbors.  It turns out that most routers use channel 1 or 6 or 11 by default.  So your first thought might be to use 2 or 5.  But that will actually make the problem worse, because 1 and 2 will be unaware of each other and just make interference.  The counter intuitive solution is to pick the same channel as your neighbor with the strongest signal.  This way the normal Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm can actually do its work.  Yep, CSMA/CA is another day of networking class, but now you can throw that around like your an expert the next time someone brings up WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all of this, we have a pretty good setup.  I can catch up on shows on all of the major networks, I can stream English Premier League Football, and FA cup, and Champions league. I can watch FoodTV, and of course we can watch anything that is on the AppleTV.  Just last night we finally got around to watching the Theory of Everything.  Of course some times are better than others, and some providers are better than others.   AppleTV is top notch all the time.  I always get a good stream on anything I watch on any of the apps on the AppleTV.  Sadly its the sports streaming FoxGo, and NBCSports Live Extra, that seem to fall down.  I don't know if they are not built out enough to handle the worldwide demand, or what the deal is.  But there is a lot of season left, so I hope they keep on improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get back home I probably will not remain a cord cutter.  Too much content still relies on me having my DirecTV password to show that I am paying for it. To often, I have to play technical support person in the middle of a show to restart the stream.  But it does make me wonder about our lake house.  Do we really need two DirecTV subscriptions, especially for the amount of time we spend watching TV there, and with our Fiber Optic connection just around the corner, the bandwidth we'll have for streaming in the middle of Wisconsin lake country will be quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

She happens to be a Luther alum, and was extremely gracious in receiving us and telling us some great stories.  I think it is always really valuable for Luther students to hear the pathways that alumni take after leaving Decorah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the group, pictured with our guide Nino.  We all loved him and will always remember the phrase &amp;quot;Nino is here&amp;quot; as it sounded inside our earbuds that constantly linked us to Nino.  Yes, Nino really does have his own website called &lt;a href="http://www.ninoknows.com"&gt;Nino Knows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Rome/colloseum_group.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting story from the ambassador involved teaching a certain beloved Luther professor how to say &amp;quot;good morning&amp;quot; in Maltese.  The prof cheerfully greeted her the rest of her days at Luther with that little bit of Malta.  Only she didn't really teach him to say good morning.  The next time you see Uwe you'll have to ask him what she really taught him to say!  I can't wait to see hime when I get back to hear his side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we asked her what an ambassador does on an average day she told us the following story, which I love, because it gets to the heart of what everyone needs to do to be successful in their career.  She said that on her first day in the foreign service an older, wiser colleague told her that on the first day she needed to go into the streets and find a butcher, and talk to the butcher about meat.  On the second day she needed to go into the streets and find a baker and talk about bread.  On the third day she needed to go into the streets and talk to the people about sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end its about networking and making connections.  This is what everyone needs to do to be successful.  Make connections with people, learn how you can help them, and how they can help you.  You will get much farther if you have a network that can collectively solve problems together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ostia Antica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostia is about a half hour train ride away from the center of Rome, back in the direction of the airport and the coast.  In fact Ostia was the port for Rome in ancient times, until it fell out of favor.  Slowly the city became covered with silt from the river until it was buried and forgotten.  The layers of silt have preserved the city very much like the ash from the volcano preserved Pompeii.  We had no formal guide this day, but it was still fun, to just walk and imagine yourself in that place in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am serving wine to the ladies at an ancient bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vatican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding behind the ancient dirty exteriors of the buildings of the old city of Rome are beautiful palaces, with works of art as beautiful as those in the Vatican Museum.  We Romans know how to live!  So says Nino, our guide for our day at the Vatican.  He is right too, when you walk around at night, and look into the windows of some of the places you see, you will notice that although the exteriors look pretty shabby, the interiors are very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a guide is really the only way to go when visiting the vatican, otherwise you just wander around aimlessly looking at stuff without knowing the story behind all of the amazing things you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always been drawn to this photo on the ceiling of the first of the Raphael rooms, wondering what it was all about.  The title really tells you all you need to know.  &lt;em&gt;The Triumph of Christianity.&lt;/em&gt;  The fresco was commissioned by Pope Gregory XII in 1582.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Rome/triumph.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was a bit cloudy it was a nice and the clouds made an excellent backdrop to the statues in St. Peter's Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Rome/rome_highlights_3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Vatican we turned the students loose for some time on their own.  Jane and I went out in search of a restaurant.  We, of course, had a couple in mind that Jane had researched prior to the trip.  However that all went out the window when we were standing outside a pub only to see Özil score a goal for Arsenal against Tottenham.  Now we were sucked in.  Reviews aside, we were right across from the Vatican at what would surely be expensive, but there was football to watch.  So into the Ris Cafe we went.  Since many patrons were there getting lunch before the Italy Ireland Rugby match there were no tables available, so we agreed that as long as we could see the game sitting at the bar was fine.  Soon a table opened up.  But it had a horrible view of the game.  So the manager asked the couple sitting at a different table to move to our table so we could have a better view. It was, but only marginally. We had just sat down and started to look at the menus when he came back and announced he had a better table for us in the other room.  So we moved again.  This time we had a great view of the game at a really nice table.  Perfect.  We were settled in and enjoying a pint of beer and the game.  Ten minutes later the manager appeared again with a grin, and said &amp;quot;now you have to go back to the bar!&amp;quot; He started laughing, and we knew he was just having some fun with us.  Sadly, the evil Tottenham Hotspurs outscored the Arsenal in the second half.  Even more sadly, was that with four minutes left in the game, they changed the channel!  The Ireland versus Italy rugby match was starting, and I believe we were the only people in the bar who cared one bit about Arsenal at that point!&lt;/p&gt;

The hotel, Smeraldo, was very conveniently located just two blocks from Piazza Fiori, and from there a quick walk to Piazza Navona and then the Pantheon.  The group shot above was taken in front of the Pantheon.  We continued our walk past the under construction Trevi fountain, and the Spanish steps where we enjoyed a night view of the newly refurbished fountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Rome/rome_highlights_8.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a nice walk we had a group meal at &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1035927-Reviews-Hostaria_Romana-Rome_Lazio.html"&gt;Hosteria Romana&lt;/a&gt;, where we (Katie) left our mark.  I hope that in future years other Luther groups will return to this restaurant, and that the logo will still be there.  If you do visit make sure you check in the back room and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our students arrived safely by 11:00 last night.  We got them up early this morning for a bit of sightseeing and wandering around Valletta.  We all did The Malta Experience, which gave us an amazing overview of the history of this island dating back to 4000 BC.  It is really incredible, Malta has been ruled by: Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Swabian, Aragonese, The Knights of St. John, French, and British!  I'm sure I left out a few!  A lot of it has to do with the fact that Malta is right on the trade route from the eastern to the western Mediterranean and beyond.  I am really looking forward to our history class which starts this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we are enjoying the sunshine, and the Amazing views that are everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

I like my nice modern home with in-floor heating and its “open concept” design.  I like my big screen TV.  I like my big kitchen with my fancy range, large refrigerator.  I like things that are new and clean.  I think that is part of what attracted to me to computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were traveling in emerging economy countries like Vietnam or Cambodia we always knew that no matter what we saw during the day,  we would return to our five star hotel in the evening and have all of the comforts of home.   We saw some very poor living conditions in some of the places we visited, and I’m working on writing up a post about that, and what Jane and I took away from that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we have moved into our flat in Malta, a developed country, with an advanced economy according the IMF. Yet, things feel very different and its going to take a while to acclimate.  Moving in to a new country was always part of the excitement of taking on the directorship of the Malta program. The point was that we would get to settle in, and actually live in a place outside of the U.S. for an extended period of time.  We are both excited about this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to note some of the things that stand out right now, in the first week or so, and then revisit this at the end of our time in Malta.  I hope what I write in the coming paragraphs will not be construed as overly negative.  I’m not judging, just trying to record my feelings and observations as we get used to a new place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="living-arrangements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Living Arrangements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we are on a mediterranean island, but they have winter too.  The highs have been in the mid fifties. We have had some rain each day, and a bit of wind.  The winters are short, and we are told that the temperatures will begin to climb again at the end of February.  Hurray!  The views of the ocean are everywhere, and they are beautiful.  I can’t wait for a bit warmer weather to take more pictures of the boats in all the little harbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Malta/first_impressions_1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we are learning how to stay warm in a big stone building. We have no heating other than a little oil filled electric radiator, and an electric blanket on our bed at night.  I SO want to go out and buy a big old 20,000 BTU gas powered heater and set it up in our hallway, but I think that will not happen.  We are learning that running the dehumidifiers is important.  Dryer air feels warmer.  We dress in layers, and use blankets while relaxing in the evening.  The chill has been the hardest thing to get used to in our first week.  I hate being cold, and knowing that I’m here until June keeps me from finding a nice warm hotel room.  We did join the health club at the Meridian Hotel, a few blocks away. The membership ensures us a nice place to work out, and a shower with LOTS of hot water.  They also have a jacuzzi and a heated indoor pool that we can soak in to warm ourselves the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is that in the daytime it is nicer outside than inside.  So yesterday we had a nice lunch on the roof in the sunshine and it was very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Malta/first_impressions_2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="getting-around"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no car.  We have no bike.  We have no scooter.  So we walk, and walk, and walk.  When we arrive at our building we climb 3 flights of stairs to get to our flat.  Walking is good, but with all the hills my shins really suffered the first couple of days.  They are getting better now.  We are also learning the bus system for the longer trips.  But really the island is not that big and we can walk almost anywhere to get what we need.  We are told that the Maltese would be appalled, as they will drive their cars two blocks to the store rather than walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have people to clean the streets and sidewalks regularly, but its amazing what litterbugs people are around here.  And many people let their dogs poop on the sidewalk!! They just leave it there for the sidewalk cleaner to pick up later.  Watch your step as you are walking.  You have to be alert to many things while you are walking.  First the sidewalks in most places are so narrow that you can’t really walk side by side.  If you meet someone, chances are one of you is going to step out into the street.  You just better hope one of the drivers doesn’t choose that moment to get the carbon out of their car and come roaring around a corner at you.  Most of the streets are one way, and are only wide enough for one lane of traffic.  I’ve talked to several people now about getting a bike and they have all strongly advised me against it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Malta/first_impressions_3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-people"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been very fortunate to be welcomed to the island by some Luther alumni, both Maltese and American expats.  This has been really nice.  We haven’t really met many people in the neighborhood yet, but we have only been here a few days, so we surely look like we are just short term visitors to most people.  The owner of the Ironmongery (a hardware store) was super nice to me today when I stopped by to purchase a gas grill for the roof.  The people at the University have been very welcoming, and we have a long list of helpful advice and things to check out.  We are looking forward to meeting more new people and reconnecting with Luther classmates who have come back to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to speak english very well, and in fact english is the co-official language of Malta.  However, most everyone we have run into seems to prefer to speak in Maltese.  I assumed that it was probably a derivative of italian, since that is what it partially sounded like to my American ears, but in fact it is Siculo-Arabic.  About half the vocabulary is standard italian, and 20% of the vocabulary is english, with the rest coming from this Sicilian Arabic dialect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="shopping"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shopping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing like a Target, or Walmart on the island.  You do all your shopping at small neighborhood stores.  If you need pharmaceuticals you go to the pharmacy on the corner.  If  you need a grill you go to the ironmongery on the other corner.  If you need electronics you go to the electronics store.  If you need wine, you can go, well, almost anywhere.  Seriously, there are all kinds of little wine shops on every street.  I honestly don’t know how they stay in business, from my own observations they don’t move a huge volume of wine in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of like this way of shopping.  Its like we do back home for groceries, the coop for this, and Fareway for that, etc. However, back home I don’t hesitate to order from Amazon.  Sadly, my Amazon Prime  membership does not cover me here in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another little thing to get used to is that most shops close up shortly after noon, and stay closed for an hour or two or three.  Then they are open again until about 7 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="eating"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I saved my favorite topic until last.  There is a wide variety of restaurants within walking distance of the flat.  Great Pizza at Piccolo Padre is just a couple blocks away.  Fish and Chips at the Scotsman Pub is a bit further, but appears to be a good place to watch EPL football, as does the Balluta bar just down the street, but we haven't tried that place yet.  Vecchia Napoli is another close by Italian place.  We had lunch there the other day and found out that we had to sit outside under a heater since we had not reserved an indoor seat in advance!  For lunch!  We are trying to balance our eating habits so that we cook either lunch or dinner at home, and then try out a variety of eating places opposite.   I'll leave this post with my favorite discovery...  I can buy an entire kilo of Parmigiano Reggiano for just 19 euros!  I may need another suitcase to bring home my cheese!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are generally late eaters back home.  I don't usually start cooking until around 6 p.m. But we are quickly learning that the dinner hour in Malta is very Mediterranean.  Most places don't even open for dinner until 7 or 7:30p.m.  With the busy time coming around 9.  Similarly, lunch time is also later with people eating at around 1 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

We leave for Malta in a few hours at 1:05 a.m.  For our last night of our Asian adventure we are staying at the Oriental Residence in Bangkok.  We are on the 19th floor, and this is our view of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Bangkok/bangkok_city_1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Bangkok/bangkok_city_2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had two very nice guides for yesterday afternoon and today.  We visited the grand palace of the king, the summer palace, and a whole bunch of temples.  The architecture of the Thai temples is different and interesting, and our guide yesterday filled in some gaps in our knowledge of Buddhism.  In Bangkok, you can see temples built using a Thai architecture,  Khmer architecture, and even a few Mosques.  We saw temples within temples.  We have lost count.  I think it is safe to say that we are now &amp;quot;templed out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangkok itself is very different from anything we have seen in Vietnam and Cambodia.  It is definitely a large modern city.  Complete with massive traffic jams and loads of tourists.  The food has been excellent.  Green Curry, Massaman Curry, Tom Yum soup.  Today out on the river we had the Tom Yum Goong (with prawns) and we told our guide to order it Thai style for us rather than &amp;quot;foreigner style.&amp;quot;   Well, let me tell you, we like our food spicy but I lost my voice after a spoonful of this!!  Oh My it was hot.   We also had a chicken and basil stir fry that was absolutely delicious.  How you can make something stir fried taste so spicy and like it just came off the grill, I don't know.  But I'm definitely going to be working on it.  We have a few bags of spices in our luggage that I hope make it through immigration in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now time to start a new chapter of this journey and we are both looking forward to arriving in Malta in about 25 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  I hope the song gets stuck in your head for a day too.  And just in case, you can't remember, I'm not sure I ever really knew them all.  But here are the lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangkok, Oriental setting
And the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa had the chess boys in it
All change, don't you know that when you
Play at this level, there's no ordinary venue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's Iceland or the Philippines
Or Hastings or, or this place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, Brother&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whaddya mean?
Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea girls, warm and sweet, warm, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham Suite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get Thai'd&amp;quot;, you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the Devil walking next to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would
A muddy old river or Reclining Buddha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thank God, I'm only watching the game, controlling it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you better go back to your bars, your temples
Your massage parlors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the Devil walking next to me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok fun fact about this song:  Along with the rest of the songs from Chess, the music was written by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, and Tim Rice wrote the lyrics.  Can you feel the love tonight?&lt;/p&gt;

This morning we had a new guide, who took us to his own village and showed us his own house.  That experience will be a part of a post that has been brewing for a week or so.  I'm going to do this one first as it is fresh in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just got back from JWOC (yes, they pronounce it jay walk) which stands for &lt;a href="http://www.journeyswithinourcommunity.org/about/"&gt;Journeys Within Our Community&lt;/a&gt;.  What a great experience!  We didn't really know a lot about what we were in for this afternoon, other than we were there to volunteer in a class, and it would involve speaking english.  So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I tell you about the class, and what we did, I want to give you a little background about JWOC and the educational system here in Cambodia.  The latter is easy.  Its pretty minimal.  Students &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; go to school from ages six to fourteen.  After that there is really not much for them.  Students may go to a private school for further education, but they are pretty expensive for most people in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JWOC has programs in five key areas:  Community Assistance, Clean Water, Microfinance, Free Classes, and Scholarships.  The scholarship program is the heart of it all.  Since 2005 JWOC has provided 120 scholarships for students to get a university education.  However, these students must in turn give back by volunteering their time on another JWOC program.  The instructor of the class we participated in this afternoon was one such student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the JWOC center in Siem Reap they have students from age 4 all the way to 60.  The classes are open to anyone in the community and range from english, to sewing, to gardening, to computers. The class we worked with was a hospitality class.  You can think of it as an enrichment course for students who are interested in improving their english so they can work in the hospitality industry.  One student wanted to be a hotel receptionist, another told us he wanted to be guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out the class with everyone introducing themselves. There was much smiling and laughing and clapping as we went around the room.  Their enthusiasm was infectious. After the intros we moved on to some role play &lt;a class="m-footnote" href="#id2" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.  The instructor paired us up, and I played the role of a tourist who wanted to book a room, while my student played the role of someone at the front desk of hotel.  I had a list of features that I wanted in my room and he had information about what they had available and the associated prices.  He was into it!  First he had to clarify several points with the instructor, and then we started out. After working our way through a fairly lengthy conversation, he said.  &amp;quot;We need to do this again.  We need to be the best so that we can perform for the class.&amp;quot;  So we did it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the teacher asked for volunteers to do their role play for the class I think he might have been a little disappointed that there was no choice based on merit, but he was undaunted and quickly volunteered us for the job.  Here we are in the front of the classroom playing our roles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/roleplay.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane also had an excellent student, that I wish I could have talked with some more.  He wants to be an engineer, and is enthusiastically studying math and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the role playing was done we had about 20 minutes for free conversation.  They divided the class in two, and put each of us with one group.  The instructor said that since I was a professor they could ask me about anything. No pressure.  We were all grinning from ear to ear even though they were a bit shy about asking questions.  They wanted to know about where I was from, and what kind of crops we had, which led to a little discussion about how cold it is in Iowa.  One of them was wearing a Chelsea shirt so that led to some quick conversation about football.  Then I asked about what I should see or things I should eat.  I think they were all impressed when I said we had already tried Amok and Lak Lok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One student had been holding back and I could tell he wanted to ask me something, but he said he was to embarrassed.  With a bit of coaxing he finally asked me: &amp;quot;what good are computers?&amp;quot;  Well, now that is a question. Nobody laughed at him for asking it.  What good is something that I take for granted and use all day everyday?  So we talked about how you could use computers to learn things, anything you wanted to know you could find out.  Only one of the students in my group had heard of Google!  We talked a little about their markets and how they bought everything they wanted at the local market.  I tried to describe how I used the computer to do my shopping.  I can buy anything I want on the computer and a truck brings it to my house in two days.  I may just as well have sprouted a second head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hour was over in no time. But we left with such respect for these students.  They were so enthusiastic and supportive of each other.  It was a class like nothing I've experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward we had a chance to talk with the education coordinator here in Siem Reap.  She is an American from Connecticut who has been here about five months and had some nice insights to share with us.  It is true that these students value education in a very different way because it is so special.  She told us about the collaborative nature of the Cambodian culture and how important that is to their educational experience.  Something that I never would have really understood before spending time here.  But I'm glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the class with all of us all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/classpic.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;dl class="m-footnote"&gt;
&lt;dt id="id2"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class="m-footnote"&gt;&lt;a href="#id1"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some great irony here as I've been known to skip out of faculty meetings where role playing is on the agenda.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

Those stairs must be climbed I said to myself.  We were only about an hour into our afternoon of bike riding when we came across this out of the way temple.  The staircases are at about a 60-70 degree angle to force people to focus on their climb to the top.  We had been looking at these all day at various temples, but in each case the authorities had helpfully built a wooden staircase at a much more gentle angle.  Out here away from the crowds was a chance to try the real thing.  So, we rode around the back, there were identical stairs on all four sides, and I stopped my bike.  &amp;quot;Just a few?&amp;quot; I asked?  OK, So I quickly climbed up about 10 or 12 stairs.  With a smile and a gesture Sina told me it was OK to continue as far as I wanted, which was all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/staircase_1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/staircase_2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this was just the beginning of a great afternoon of adventures on our rented mountain bikes.  The bikes allowed us to get to places of the giant temple complex that most people don't go to because its a long walk on paths that are not very well marked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You carry your bike through a dry creek bed and an ancient door on the other side and you are treated to another amazing site.  Way in the far back of the temple we did some serious mountain biking, and climbing.  Even our guide asked us to take a picture of himself on his bike to show his friends.  Actually I think he posted it on Facebook immediately.  Look where I took the crazy Americans today! This was toward the end of our ride, so you can see some of the amazing golden colors of the late afternoon sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/jane_climb.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/mountain_bike.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One place we did get off the bikes and walk around was at the Bayon temple.  This was built by King  Jayavarman VII. Yeah, I can't say it either -- even after hearing our guide say it several times.  We ended up just going by seven.  My favorite was Udayadityavarman I who predated VII by about 80 years.  Anyway, Jayavarman VII was a very long lived king, and a very good king.  He built many temples, and took care of the people.  They have a children's hospital in Siem Reap named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/bayon_temple.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you are walking through the temples with the guide it is really interesting to hear about the history.  Many of the temples were originally built as Hindu temples and then later converted into Buddhist temples.  Some are the other way around, it just depended on who was in charge at the time they were built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the temples we visited were built between 950 and 1180.  At some point most of them were abandoned and fell into ruin until they were rediscovered largely by the French in the early 1900's.  Of course some of the discoverers were corrupt and tried to loot the temples and sell off the amazing bas relief stone carvings back home.  But others financed the beginnings of the restoration of these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of those towers in the Bayon temple has the face of Jayavarman VII on four sides.  It is said that this symbolizes that the king was watching everything and everyone at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Cambodian government is quite corrupt, and it is quite a poor country,  many of the restoration projects we saw over the last few days were financed by other countries.  Some by Japan and Korea, to provide a great tourism experience for their people, others by India and other countries for maybe more altruistic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other bit of excitement for the day happened when we made a comfort stop.  It turned out the elephants were headed to the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

After a full day of travel yesterday, from Halong Bay, and a crazy arrival process in Siem Reap, we started our first full day in Cambodia plenty early.  Our guide and driver met us at reception at 5 a.m and we headed for Angkor Wat in the darkness.  We wanted to get a good spot to watch the sun rise behind the temple.  When we got there the moon was still up and it was pitch dark.  But as we sat and got to know our guide a bit, we began to see a shadow of the temple emerge from the dark sky.  Gradually, the day dawned, and the clouds reddened and the temple became fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was worth the short night to join the throngs of other people and see the sun come up.  As we sat and began to wonder if we would see our friends Ann and Jerry among all of the other people there, Jane suddenly said  &amp;quot;is that Jerry?&amp;quot;  Then a moment later she spotted Ann and we started waving.  So right there we had a little reunion with our friends and traveling companions.  Since it was the right time, Jerry and I did an abbreviated workout in honor of our P90X buddies back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/SiemReap/temple_p90x.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We each had to go on our way for the day, Jerry and Ann with their Luther Students in tow, and us with our Guide Sina to visit the temple.  We will meet up with them for dinner in town tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we are resting after being at the temple for about 4 hours.  We'll meet our guide again at 1:00 for lunch and a bike ride to the Angkor Thom temple.&lt;/p&gt;

So I just realized four months later that it has not been finished or published.   I will finish and publish it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my earliest memories are of a small house in a small town in Southwestern Minnesota in the late 1960's.  My Grandma Sundahl lived in this house.  As you came in the side door, you could turn left and go up a few stairs to the kitchen, or straight down the stairs to the basement.  The basement had three rooms, a laundry room off to the left as you went down the stairs.  I remember big crockery bowls on the counter in that room and a big black adding machine that we could play with endlessly.  To the right was a cinder block room with a cement floor.  Grandma had painted the walls and decorated them with big posters of the Campbell Soup kids.  There was a ping pong table at one end.  As far as I can remebmer the other end of that room was open for us to run around in.  Straight ahead as you reached the bottom of the stairs was the big dark scary room.  there was a shower in there, that I never really wanted to shower in.  This was also the room where Grandpa Sundahl's tools were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the kitchen the sink was straight ahead as you entered with a window to the back yard yard.  I remember using the hand mixer in that sink hundreds of times to make more bubbles out of the dish soap. To the right of the sink was a stack of shelves.  The third door down was the magic drawer.  There was always a package of M&amp;amp;M's for each of us, and this was where Grandma kept the matches for her cigarettes, which we hid endlessly.  Behind the sink was the gas stove and refrigerator.  A felix the cat clock was on the wall over the small kitchen table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the living room was a black and white television.  If we wanted to watch Rocky and Bullwinkle we would have to turn the rotor to  point the antenna towards Sioux Falls in the west.  Sadly, Lawrence Welk was non-negotiable and required the rotor to point the antenna towards Mankato in the Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upstairs was my personal kingdom.  The stairway divided the small dormer style upstairs room into two halves.  There was a half-wall around the stair to keep you from falling, and we would endlessly pile up grandma's pillows on a blanket that we stretched across and over the stair.  We would call grandma to come upstairs and then drop the pillows on her.  Amazingly she never caught on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Storden we were allowed to walk anywhere on our own.  We could go to Witt's grocery store and get groceries for grandma, and of course a pushup, or some other ice cream treat for our efforts.  As far as I remember no money was exchanged everything was done on account.  Down the road from the grocery store was the elementary school with swings, teeter totters, and of course the tall metal slippery slide with a big hump in the middle.  Nothing was made of plastic in those days, there were no soft recycled bits of anything to land in at the bottom of the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why I've just written four paragraphs of memories about small town Minnesota life in the late 60's when I'm in the middle of Cambodia.  Actually I'm a bit surprised myself, but once I started, the memories kept following one after the other, and it seemed right to get them down. Maybe this blog needs a good editor! Still, its a valid question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot about those early days as I've been traveling through Vietnam and now Cambodia these last few weeks.  Its not a conscious effort on my part, the memories just keep arising as we drive around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My learning style is to make connections between things I know and the things I'm learning.  I find patterns, and make associations.  You may be wondering what connections and parallels I see between Southwest Minnesota and the Southeast Asian countries of Vietnam and Cambodia.  To me the parallels are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, these memories of my childhood represent a simple &amp;quot;make do&amp;quot; style of living.  We had fun, but it wasn't expensive and it wasn't complicated.  Later in life I learned that my Mom, the oldest child, and grandma and grandpa had lived in the basement for a period in order to save the money to build the rest of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Here we pick up the thread several months later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four months in Malta and around the Mediterranean, I think I understand why I was writing a lot of what I wrote.  I comes down to thinking about your own lifestyle.  The stark contrast in January between my own lavish lifetyle and the lifestyle I've lived in Malta these last four months is pretty amazing.  I have learned to live with &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; less than I do at home, I have learned to enjoy cooking and eating even without my gourmet kitchen, I have accomplished a lot of development work on projects that I am truly passionate about with nothing but a laptop and an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flat we live in was built in the 1950's probably a decade after the house in Storden was built.  There is almost nothing in common between this long narrow limestone flat, and the house in Storden other than the shared experiences of the members of the generation that built each structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about Malta is that the tension between the generations is more evident to me on Malta than it is in my own country.  There is a real sadness among the older generation about how the island has changed in the last 30 years, and i guess I honestly can't say how the younger generation feels, but I can observe their actions as they overbuild, and overuse the limited resources available to them on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

Four hundred thirty seven stairs to climb to the top of Ti Top island.  The island was named by Ho Chi Minh, and a Russian astronaut.  From the very top of this island you get a panoramic view of all of the junks and other nearby islands.  What can you say about the views in one of the seven natural wonders of the world?  Good Job selection committee!  You can take all of the adjectives you can think of amazing, beautiful, breathtaking, romantic, peaceful and it still won't do justice to what you see in Halong Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/halongbay/titop.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded our Junk, Violet, around 1:00 p.m three days ago.  Our cruise director, Tom (One of the few Vietnamese we've met that uses an American name), gave us a short safety demonstration, in place of the usual lifeboat drill.  We were then shown to our suite.  We were in the water suite, old creaky wooden floors, windows everywhere, and a TV we never turned on in one corner.  The bathroom was larger than some American cruise ship staterooms we have stayed in.  The balcony opened to the front of the boat.  Our room was just above water level, with the window going all the way to the floor, so it was almost like living and sleeping right on top of the water.  There are only six suites on the ship, this first night they are all occupied by four Americans, six Brazilians, and two Swiss honeymooners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we ate our lunch, and chatted with the other American couple the boat got underway.  We really wished that we were not trapped in the dining room as it was our first exposure to the islands of Halong Bay. There are almost two thousand small islands in Halong Bay.  The Limestone islands seem to jut straight out of the water and the sides are so steep that few are inhabited.  Just for Mike,  I will say that the geology of the bay is ancient karst (like Decorah!) Resulting from over 500 million years of sea regression, tectonic down-warping and sea transgression. Soon enough, we were done with lunch and up on the top deck to enjoy the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the afternoon, we visited a floating village.  The people live here year around.  I heard others say that they live a very primitive existence, I think primitive is the wrong word. Simple would be a better choice in my opinion.  They have some electricity, by means of a generator.  They use it for charging their cell phones, and powering televisions and other appliances.  Their diet, as you might expect, includes a lot of fish.  Everything else, they have to get from the mainland and bring back by boat.  Its a way of life they have chosen, and so they seem happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the visit to the floating city we take our boat to the Tien Ong cave.  Here we can see many freshwater mussel shells and some stalactites and stalagmites.  We leave the cave just in time to get back to the boat to watch the sunset over the islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very glad that we signed up for a two night stay on the boat, as the second day gave us more time to enjoy the scenery and and do some biking and Kayaking. We left the Violet for most of the day, so that it could go back to port and drop off the one-night passengers, and pick up another group.  As it turned out there was only one other couple, from Toronto, on the boat our second night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Violet went back to port, we transferred to the Sunset with a couple from Perth Australia.  We had a great time talking with them and touring Cat Ba island.  We did a 6k bike ride to a small village where we were able to tour the village and learn about the endangered Langur monkey.  Biking around the island gave us another perspective of the interior of the island which is equally as beautiful as the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our bike ride, we had lunch and then continued on to the Bat Cave where we were able to do some kayaking for about an hour.  Kayaking in and out of small bays, and under the eroded limestone tunnels was a great experience.  In one small bay we had hoped to see some monkeys, but they were shy, or on their own vacation so we did see them.  After we returned to the Sunset, Ron and Jane were brave enough to do some swimming.  I had dipped my hand in the water when we were kayaking and had long since decided against a swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/halongbay/batcave.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/halongbay/kayaking.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hour of relaxing -- our host on the Sunset was very big on that word -- we returned to the Violet for another great sunset, some wine, and a good meal.  Having no internet we read and just enjoyed the quiet of the bay.  Once all the boats are settled for the night it is incredibly quiet.  All the engines are off and the lights from the other boats make for quite a romantic scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/halongbay/nightships.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were having our breakfast this morning, on the way back to the mainland, Jane and I both agreed that Halong Bay was our number one experience of the trip so far.  Its kind of sad to rank our experiences because it needlessly gives the impression that one experience is a winner, and others are somehow less.  It really is the totality of everything we have done in the last 17 days that makes this such a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

Tomorrow we board a Junk on Halong Bay, and I'm certain we will not have Internet for our two days at sea.  The next day is a travel day to Cambodia, so I won't have access for most of that day either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I initially requested that we include some biking days in Vietnam, I had the kind of biking I do back home in mind.  Road bike by Trek, a nice smooth open road with rice paddies on one side, and Water Buffalo peacefully grazing on the other; sunny weather with no breeze and low humidity.   Perfect right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fantasy only goes to show how little I knew about Vietnam.  Here is a picture of me on today's bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hanoi/brad_bike.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a trek, although in Vietnam this is a prized bicycle.  You must be one of the top workers in order to obtain this bicycle according to our guide.  Now, I'm going to call this a fixie.  It had only one gear so that mostly qualifies.  Although it does have handbrakes and I can coast, so that works against true fixie classification.  The second thing you may have noticed is that it is woefully undersized for me.  The seat posts in Vietnam do not allow for much adjustment for American height males.  And the frame is similarly small.  People in the market were literally laughing at the big american on the small bike as we rode by today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this really makes me appreciate two things.   One:  bicycles are an important and prized mode of transportation here.  We have seen thousands of people riding them to work and school each day, in big cities and small villages.  Two:  The importance of a bike that actually fits you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we were not on nice trek road bikes, the scenery today was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bike ride, we had lunch at the home of Ms Qiy.  She is a retired professor of Vietnamese culture at one of the universities in Hanoi.  But now she lives in her family home outside of hanoi.  Their family home goes back 21 generations!  She lives in the home with her youngest brother, and his children.   At the back of the home is a shrine where they worship all of their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hanoi/hanoi_cooking_1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Lunch we had fried spring rolls, some delicious pork wrapped in La Lota leaves, along with salad and rice vermicelli noodles.  We got another nice lesson (and top secret recipe) for making spring rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hanoi/hanoi_cooking_2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hanoi/hanoi_cooking_3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were hoping to visit a primary school to speak english with some of the students but that did not work out as it is near the end of the year, and the principal and teachers had meetings that conflicted.  On the other hand we were greeted by many school children as we left the village today.  They all enjoy saying Hello to us, partly because we stick out so much, and partly because I think they want to see if we will respond.  These two were especially cute as they chased us down the street on their bikes.  Not only did we get a &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; from them but also a &amp;quot;good afternoon.&amp;quot;  When we stopped and asked them their names they became very shy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday, 12:30 p.m.:  Our guide told us the best way of visiting the war museum here in Saigon is to start on the third floor and work your way down.  As we rounded the staircase onto the second floor we were met with the title for the main gallery on that floor:  &amp;quot;War Crimes of America&amp;quot;  Wow!  I wasn't expecting that.  Suddenly I felt very uncomfortable.  Throughout the museum we were confronted with images and stories of Agent Orange, senseless killings, Graphs depicting the numbers of bombs dropped on Vietnam in various years, and the use of Napalm.  Clearly museums are not just dry exhibitions of facts, but can have their own point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, 10:00 a.m.:  Our first stop today is at a family run restaurant of the girl, Kim Phuc, she is widely known as &amp;quot;The girl in the picture&amp;quot;  A pulitzer prize winning photo that many say galvanized the antiwar movement in the United States.  It is a haunting photo, and the rest of her story is very moving.  It is not easy to hear, it is even more difficult to imagine that our country would do that to a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/TrangBang.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, 1:00 p.m.: Our final stop of the day is at the Cu Chi tunnels where we meet a Viet Cong veteran, and watch a 1967 documentary that extolls the virtues of the &amp;quot;war heroes&amp;quot; who killed many americans, and destroyed many American Tanks.  We learn about the cleverness and the bravery of the Viet Cong who set booby traps to kill the Americans, and lived in the tunnels of Cu Chi for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday, 4 a.m.: I awoke with a start, my heart was pounding, and my thoughts were already on the day ahead.  Today was a biking day in the Mekong Delta, but tonight was our &amp;quot;home stay&amp;quot; night. I was a little panicked. Our guide had informed us last night that there would be no hot water and no air conditioning at our home stay.  The high today would be over 90 degrees, and the humidity about what you would expect in the Jungle. We saw a lot of houses that I would not want to stay in the previous day.  I think to myself, &amp;quot;Is there any way to get out of this?  Why would I want to do a home stay when I am in this really nice hotel?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, 1:30PM: Our guide invites me to turn around, so that he can drape a Python over my shoulders.  I have a lifelong fear of snakes, and as you can see, this is a big one.  However, since I teach a programming language by the same name, and I know that many of my first year students struggle with the language, it somehow seems appropriate for me to over come that fear, and so the snake goes around my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/brad_python.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my wife Jane and I told people we were going to Vietnam, we saw many different reactions: confused, worried, envious, and even peevishness. The mention of this country is capable of invoking a wide variety of emotions in people.  I guess that is inevitable; there is the ghost of the war, and many have friends and family who died here. For some Vietnam is too far away, we are 13 hours ahead of Decorah and Luther College time. Politics: along with China and Cuba Vietnam is one of the few remaining communist countries.  So why did we decide to go here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gereon Kopf recently posted about being uncomfortable. I agree with him that  &amp;quot;stepping outside your comfort zone&amp;quot; is a good thing.  It is a thing that we ask our students to do regularly, and so as a faculty member I think it is something we ought to ask of ourselves as well.  One good way for me to do this is through traveling and experiencing new cultures and new points of view.  Southeast Asia has long been on our travel bucket list, and since we will be directing the Malta program for Luther this Spring we decided that going to Malta the long way around, with a stop in Vietnam was a good way to extend our travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vignettes at the start of this post illustrate several ways in which I have been pushed out of my comfort zone in only the first few days of our trip.  Now the difficulty for me is that I am a problem solver by nature.  Accusations of war crimes, pictures of young girls bombed with Napalm, comments from relatives that imply that our being here &amp;quot;on vacation&amp;quot; is somehow disrespectful to those who lost their lives in this country, and Pythons all cry out to be solved in some way.  but there is nothing here I can solve, nothing really to fix.  The things that are making me uncomfortable have largely happened in the past.  There is nothing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own feelings about the war are not defined by personal experience. I was born after the US entered the conflict, and was only in kindergarten at the height of the bombing in 1969. I have no father or uncle or cousin who fought in the war. It wasn't a topic that was covered in U.S. History classes when I was in High School, until now, most of my knowledge of the war came from Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning we had an interesting conversation with our guide. We asked her what they teach about the American war in school.  She told us, &amp;quot;we teach that you are bad.&amp;quot; She told us that she used to be a math teacher, from a communist family.  But then she married a non-communist from the south.  She was blacklisted, and so her prospects as a teacher were at an end.  Her husband's father abandoned his family and fled the country right after the war, becoming one of the many &amp;quot;boat people.&amp;quot;  She told us that she knows that we are not bad people.  She encouraged us to tell our friends to visit. This seems to be true of nearly everyone else we have had contact with.  As a guide she has taken many American veterans back to their former battlefields, and she told us how they are all so grateful to see that Vietnam has healed and progressed as a country.  It was a wonderful conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/delta_sunrise.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, 6:30 AM: I am sitting under a thatched roof, at the edge of the river, enjoying the sunrise, listening to the Roosters crow, as they have done for the last two hours.  Our home stay turned out to be a rather pleasant visit.  I got to make fried Spring rolls in the kitchen with our hosts last night, and although the mattress was a bit hard and our room a bit stuffy we slept.  The beautiful sunrise reminds me that everything is alright.  More than alright, I am lucky to be here, lucky to have this experience that gives me a new perspective on our world.  The challenge for me going forward, as it is for all Luther students, is how I will live out this new perspective in the days and years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for an entertaining evening of dining.  I'm just sorry it had to come at the expense of that nice young assistant manager you abused for the better part of thirty minutes.  What was it about the graffiti filled walls and sticky menu pages that made you think you were in for a fine dining experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a day of visiting the Imperial City and the Tomb of Ming Minh we were in the mood for a drink and a pizza.  You ordered some vegetables on rice.  You were looking for vegetables that were steamed to preserve their color, yet mushy in texture.  I hope you are continuing on to Hoi An.  I would be happy to recommend a good cooking school.  First you sent the vegetables back.  Then you sent the rice back to be sure it would stay hot.  Then you sent the vegetables back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some debate you decided they were not capable of cooking your vegetables how you wanted them.  I'm pretty sure that at this place the vegetables are microwaved.  So, you ordered something and mashed potatoes.   This was also returned to the kitchen.  The look on the poor boy's face when he brought you your third choice was one of pure fright.  He clearly could not imagine that there was any scenario in which you would enjoy your food and honestly I think he was afraid you would grab him by the neck and shake him.  I wanted to rush over and put my arm around him to let him know that he was not alone., that there were those of us around who would protect him should it come to violence over the quality of the carrots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You then pulled aside another member of the waitstaff and gave him a lecture on the proper way to steam vegetables.  I can only imagine that he immediately ran back to tell the chef what he (or she) had been doing wrong all this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching your husband during all of this was priceless.  Clearly this is a story he has seen unfold many times.  He and your son calmly ate what was brought to them, enjoying their meal and a beer.  They were, of course, long done before you had something you were willing to eat.  So they patiently waited while you ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost fell out of my seat when the waiter timidly asked if you would like desert.  I'm pretty sure there was nothing he wanted more than for you to simply vanish.  Sadly you refused desert, and so our show came to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you learned nothing while visiting this country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we visited the Thien Mu pagoda and the tomb of Minh Mang.  We travelled by boat on the perfume river.  The boat was owned by a nice couple, with two young children.  They live on their boat.  It is not heated, there is no running water.  It is typical of so many of the boats we have used for transportation here in Vietnam.  It has a crank start engine.  This is not uncommon for this class in Hue.  The government tried to relocate them to low income housing, but most of them prefer their boats.  So, after trying their apartment they have moved back to the boat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather has been cold and rainy here in Hue, so it makes everything seem a bit oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting story from the tomb, which covers acres of space is that the king's body was brought in by a secret tunnel, and laid to rest in one of many many tunnels that were dug in preparation for the burial.  After the body was left, the workers that carried the casket to its final resting place were beheaded to keep the final location a secret!&lt;/p&gt;

No, I said in English we would pronounce that &amp;quot;Hang me!&amp;quot;  He got it, and and mimicked tightening a noose around his neck.  We had a good morning with our guide, Vu, he was a last minute stand-in, as our appointed guide had come down with a high fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang Me, is definitely not a place we would have wandered into on our own.  It was the kind of local restaurant that was in the wrong place and looked a little too grungy from the outside for me to even go in.  We ended up at Hang Me because our guide had asked us whether we would like to go to a tourist restaurant or whether we would like to try some good local food.  It may have been a bit of a leading question put that way, but we opted for the local food, he had earned our trust so far today.  The local specialties include Banh Beo, Bahn Nam, Tom Cha, and Bahn Ram it.  Need I say more?  All of these were variations on a dumpling like theme.  A rice flour mixture with prawn and or pork.  They were OK, but in the end they all kind of blended together in a gooey-rice-mixture-with-prawns kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hue/hangme.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;section id="the-thien-vien-truc-lam-bach-ma-pagoda"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Thien Vien Truc Lam Bach Ma Pagoda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked up our appetite by climbing 173 stairs to the Thien Vien Truc Lam Bach Ma Pagoda.  At this point in the trip it might be easy to say that we are &amp;quot;pagodaed out.&amp;quot;  But, that is not the case today.  It was a bit of a journey to get there but it was well worth the trip.  This Pagoda is set on an island in the middle of a quiet lake surrounded by high hills (they actually call them mountains here).  After driving through the trees and countryside you arrive at a little parking area, from there you have to hike a bit more on foot before you come to the boat landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is winter here, the water levels in the lake are a bit hight, and our boatman made the suggestion that we wade a bit to get to his boat.  But our guide quickly convinces him that is not going to happen.  So we do a little balancing act on a 2x6 to get on the boat and he pushes off.  He starts the boat with a hand crank.  The motor has two settings, forward and stop.  The throttle is controlled by a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at the island we disembark and hike up to the pagoda and monastery area.  It is just beautiful.  Aside from the two buildings, one for chanting and one for meditating, the setting is just unreal.  We wish it wasn't raining, because the colors must be incredibly vibrant in the sunlight.  Even so, we feel like we could be on a movie set for some jungle adventure.  The whole time we are there are only see two other people which just adds to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-postscript-about-football"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Postscript about Football&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not American football, English football.  Its amazing to me what a global league the English Premier League is.  Here I am finishing up my blog post about today while watching Liverpool play Sunderland on TV at 9:00PM, the game started at 7:45PM.  Of course back home this came would be the &amp;quot;early&amp;quot; game at 6:45AM.  We have struck up conversations with most of the hotel bar staff as well as the bellman, it was the bellman who knew how to get the lobby TV to the right channel.  Our guide today knew the names of every member of the Arsenal Invincibles as well as all the current members of Manchester United.&lt;/p&gt;

Today was our first official lesson, at the Red Bridge Cooking School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hoian/red_bridge_1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our day started out with a tour of the market, which was nothing new, except that this time we were guided around by Chef Luna.  For the tour we were put into groups of four.  We met a very nice couple from Southampton England and had great conversation with them all day.  Phil and Jane.  It even turns out that her maiden name was Jane Miller, so what are the odds of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market tour we took a boat ride out to the restaurant and cooking school, and had another brief tour of their herb garden.  We are getting lots of ideas for things to plant in our own garden next summer that we hope will grow in the Iowa summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hoian/red_bridge_2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then its time for the real lessons to begin.  We each get a clipboard with seven pages of recipes!  Luna demonstrates how to make our first course.  This is a rice flour pancake with shrimp and pork and green onion.  When its done we wrap it up in some rice paper with herbs and salad.  Then you make a quick dipping sauce to accompany the rolls. After the demonstration we are told to leave our recipes at our seats and to find a station.  Now it is time to cook!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am getting ready to make my pancake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hoian/red_bridge_3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really getting in a lot of healthy eating this trip.  You just can't avoid adding in all of the delicious vegetables to your dishes, and I have to admit they really do taste good.  Who knows, this could be the start of a whole new relationship with vegetables for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Hoian/red_bridge_4.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern set in the first recipe was repeated several times.  Our full menu includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seafood Salad served in a Pineapple boat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh rice paper rolls of shrimp.  Yes we learned how to make our own rice paper!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vietnamese Eggplan in clay pot.  I can't believe I ate eggplant and actually liked it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steamed ocean fish on a bed of fresh vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so fun to make everything, and we can't wait to recreate this cooking school experience for our friends back home.&lt;/p&gt;

We kept telling ourselves &amp;quot;we are traveling light, everything fits in our carryon.  We will not check any luggage.&amp;quot;  Until today.  The markets of Hoi An have won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crack in the dam came yesterday when we visited an art gallery full of beautifully embroidered works of art.  Today, during our free time, we went back.  There were three pieces that we really liked.  We narrowed the field down to my second and third choices.  From there we nearly flipped a coin to decide.  We thought about shipping the entire thing, frame and all, since the frame prices were so reasonable, but in the end we decided to just take the cloth.  The cloth is easy to transport and takes up very little space, and can be ironed when we get back home before we frame the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that little purchase we were hungry and decided to have lunch.  One of the places our tour company recommended in Hoi An is called  &lt;a href="http://www.streetsinternational.org"&gt;Streets&lt;/a&gt;.  We had a fantastic lunch, and learned a bit about this interesting organization for helping street kids by giving them 18 months of housing, food, and training in hospitality and the culinary arts.  A delicious meal from a great organization.  So I bought their cookbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love buying cookbooks. I love reading cookbooks. I am a cookbook collector. There is no better way to remember the culture of a place than to be recreate the food you ate while visiting. And besides, what could be easier to transport and lighter to add to your luggage than a full color cookbook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one problem.  I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR A COOKBOOK.  So we did what any sane travelers would do.  We bought some chopsticks, and little wooden things to rest your chopsticks on, and a box to hold all of our new chopsticks.  In fairness, I have to say that the chopsticks are made from the wood of a Jackfruit tree.  Jane's new favorite fruit.  Then Jane bought some Genie Jammy pants, and a scarf, and I bought a couple of leather bracelets.  Accessorize, accessorize!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to stop the flow of new goods into our possession, we fled back to the shopping free zone that is our hotel.  Sadly, we didn't make it past the leather bag store, Tu Chi, that we were &amp;quot;just browsing&amp;quot; in yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young lady that runs the shop recognized us, and probably had us pegged as easy marks.  She had some help from a guy who I imagine is her distributor in Russia. He did a nice sales job on the size, and construction quality of the bags.  The one I really liked was a bit too large to make it past persnickety airline gate agents, so they said they would make me one that conforms to all the rules.  Out comes the leather, in great big bolts.  Which leather would I like, how would I like the top to zip open?  How would I like the straps to be constructed.  There was some discussion, from our new Russian friend, of carrying 20 kilos of potatoes.  Sounds good in theory, but that would be over the weight limit of most airlines.  Nevertheless this custom bag thing is all very cool.  I'll update this post with the finished product tomorrow evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we will be checking a bag for the flight to Hanoi after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:  Here is a picture of the bag in progress, and the bag packed and ready for the airport in our hotel room in Hue.&lt;/p&gt;

Our first day on the motorbikes, we went into the market.  The first street we turned down was nothing but bits and pieces of motorbikes.  After all, it takes a lot of parts to keep the millions of 20 year old motorbikes running.  From there we saw everything from television remote controls, to hand wound springs, to big pieces of metal being cut with very hot torch-like things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It progressed to the food market.  A vast array of over 1000 stalls carrying everything from dried sea cucumber to sea monkeys to wood ear mushrooms to live eels to every imaginable spice to picked, well,  everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days ago in the smaller neighborhood market in the Mekong delta, we witnessed women buying fresh frogs.  They were alive, until the seller whipped out their kitchen shears and took care of the head and their horny little toes.  How do you top fresh frog in the morning?  Hmmm, how about a stop at the rat market?  Rats not your thing?  How about fresh snake?  I asked Long if the rats were cheap thinking thats what the poorer folk ate.  No, &amp;quot;very expensive&amp;quot;  They are a delicacy.  These are &amp;quot;good rats from the fields, not the rats from the market.&amp;quot;  OK, I don't think I really wanted to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited the floating markets of Cai Be, where you can buy sweet potatoes, bananas, fish, and crabs in massive quantities off of boats from all around Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have ridden our bikes past countless tiny markets, sandwiched between two houses in the countryside, selling soda, cigarettes, Pho, and Pringles.  Yes, Pringles are surprisingly popular in the small neighborhood markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to resist buying food items from the markets because you know there is no chance that it is going to make it through customs at the next stop.  So we look, we smell, we marvel at the variety.  One Australian dude we overheard as we wandered through the food market yesterday pretty much summed it up:  &amp;quot;F#ck I wish I could cook!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos that illustrate our trips through the market places of Saigon, the Mekong Delta, and now Hoi An.&lt;/p&gt;

Hoi An, is a very much a vacation area for Vietnamese and foreigners alike.  It is a World Heritage site and will provide us with some very welcome down time.  Maybe more down time than we planned on since it is supposed to rain the next two days, and I don't think we will do our bike ride if it is raining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long took us to the airport and escorted us through the checkin process and all the way to security where we bid him goodbye.  It is really comforting traveling with a well trained guide in a country where you can barely say, hello and thank you. They make everything go smoothly.  After a short flight to Danang, we were met by our guide Binh who will be with us for our time in Hoi An.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking in to the beautiful Ananantara Resort Hotel we went with Binh for some lunch and a walking tour of the old city.  This is definitely a shopping destination, and I have a feeling we will be buying (and shipping home) some embroidered artwork.  It is so finely done it is nearly photo realistic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After resting up in our room we went out for a walk through the markets and shops at night.  It is really beautiful here at night.  The gallery below gives you a good idea of the colors here at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We totally enjoyed a long walk through the old town.  After a while we stopped at a restaurant called the Seafood Garden.  It didn't look particularly great as a place to eat, and without a data plan we couldn't just pop up trip advisor.  Well we do have a data plan but it is ridiculously expensive (thanks Verizon), and it seemed obvious just by looking.  (Update:  TripAdvisor confirms our suspicions) But they had an upstairs balcony that we could sit at and have a drink and look out over the river.  The drinks were cheap, and it was entertaining to watch the old gentleman who was waiting tables hustle tours from all of the other people around us for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to go back to the restaurant where we had lunch, as I think we spend a few days just happily working our way through the menu, however they were booked for the night.  Who knew you needed reservations in this place.  We ended up eating at the Hai Cafe where we had some nice Vietnamese barbecue.  This is the restaurant where we will meet for our cooking class tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture pretty much sums up our experience here the last two days.  We have both pushed ourselves outside our comfort zone, we have tried many new foods,  and even took a sip of rice wine that had been marinating with cobra!  Where do you go after a day like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we left our hotel in the city and headed out to the Meekong Delta.  This is an extremely fertile area where the Meekong river flows into the Sea.  We started our day loading our bikes onto a boat and we headed up the river into the delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/meekong_delta_3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a stop along the way at a brick factory.  It is such a step back in time, to visit a factory like this in Vietnam.  We simply got off the boat and wandered around talking to a few of the workers.  No badges required, no hard helmets,  no insurance waivers.   Its a pretty simple process, clay comes out of the river, and goes into a little hand operated machine that mikes the clay and extrudes the bricks.  After drying on their own for a few weeks they eventually make it into a big kiln which is fired by rice husks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off the boat, along with our bikes at another small factory, this time they were making all kinds of things out of coconuts.  Coconut water, candy, coconut milk, shaved coconut.  If it was possible to squeeze another product out of coconut they would find a way to do it.  Before we set off on our bikes we had a whole plate of fruit to try.  Including dipping your fresh pineapple into a mixture of salt and chile peppers -- delicious.  I ate more fruit yesterday than I have in a year.   Which isn't saying much good about my diet, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so of biking through the tiny backroads of the delta we stopped for lunch.  A great outdoor restaurant that basically appeared out of nowhere.  One minute we were biking through the trees and the next we were pulling into a &amp;quot;neighborhood restaurant.&amp;quot;  Our first course was fried spring rolls.  Love em.  Our second consisted of a whole Elephant Ear fish, fried and presented standup style for us.  For you aquarium keepers this is also known as a Giant Gourami.  I've had gouramis in my aquarium before, but I never thought I'd eat one. Anyway, we learned how to eat this by rolling the fish, along with some rice noodles and some pineapple and cucumber and mint, and basil in rice paper.   The third course was a noodle soup which also had two giant prawns for us to try.  Then came a course which consisted of a bowl of rice and some chicken curry.  Of course by this time we were totally stuffed, and leaving all kinds of food on the table.  So of course they have to bring dessert.  Well, more fruit at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly do not know how all of the vietnamese people stay so healthy and slim.  From what I have observed in the last three days they eat insane quantities of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we do a bunch more biking, and then end up at our &amp;quot;homestay&amp;quot; house.  This was the part of the trip that had me the most nervous.  Honestly, I like my nice hotels, I'm really more of an introvert when it comes to meeting new people, so showing up at someone's house in the middle of the delta, knowing in advance that the house did not have air conditioning, internet, or hot water seemed like a bad idea.   But it all worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/meekong_homestay.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great highlights of the evening was our spring roll lesson.  Yep, in a real Vietnamese kitchen I got to learn first hand how to make one of my all time favorite foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/meekong_delta_2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty early night, and as it turned out pretty sleepless as well.  We were hot, and our mattress was pretty hard, &amp;quot;softer than cement&amp;quot; according to Jane.  So it was early to bed early to rise.  We had a quick breakfast, and then biked to the local market.  In the delta, locally grown is not a &amp;quot;movement,&amp;quot; it is a way of life, and has been for years.  The pork that is sold fresh at the market was butchered just hours ago, and it will all be consumed before the day is out.  Fish, eel, frogs, etc. are all still alive and swimming when you get there, when you pick out what you want they will fillet them for you.  It was all caught today, and it will all be eaten today.   The produce is a similar story with more kinds of fruits and vegetables available than I can even think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/meekong_delta_4.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the local market we meet up with our driver again, and we head somewhere else on the delta to visit the Cai Be floating market.  This is similar to the local market but here things come, by boat, from further away.  Each boat sells its specialty, and you can tell what they are selling because they have it flying from a flagpole on the boat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where things take a turn for the weird.  It seems that Long has decided we need to be challenged.  So after we get off the boat and bike for a few feet, he stops and says he wants to show us &amp;quot;how they make honey&amp;quot;  OK, fine we get to see a beehive, but thats not enough, as he wants me to hold it.  There must be a thousand bees on this thing and he wants me to just stay calm and hold the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be easy compared to the next lesson: a big jar, whats in the jar?  Looks like snakes to me.  Gross. Have I mentioned my lifelong fear of snakes?  OK, so its a jar full of rice wine and snakes.  Lets see what kind of snake?  Oooooh a Cobra, glad its dead and pickled.  Glad he didn't tell me they were lurking around on the delta until now.  Lets have a toast shall we?  Um, really?  you want me to drink rice wine that has been marinating a dead cobra?  Fine.  Well, it mostly tasted like strong rice wine, but apparently I'm going to be stronger tomorrow.  Yes, just in case you were wondering, they do have a similar variety featuring a scorpion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/snake_wine.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the giant Python.  After pulling it out of its cage, and informing us that it is not poisonous, but does bite.  He says, ok Brad, your turn.  Really!   I can assure you that holding a giant Python has never been on my list of things I want to try.  I can also assure you that I had not consumed enough rice wine and cobra to give me the courage to do this.  But, something deep inside me said, if you are going to teach Python you ought to have a picture of yourself holding a giant one.  So there you have it.  More on the Meekong Delta later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/tunnell_rat_1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you like to live for nine years in an underground house?  Yesterday we met Mr. Nam, who did just that.  Mr. Nam fought for the Viet Cong.  First against the French, then against the Americans.  The Cu Chi area is now a park where you can learn about the Viet Cong, including a very one-sided video produced in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can actually tour the tunnels.  In the gallery below you can see me entering the tunnel through one of the many hidden entrances.  I emerge again a few minutes later at another hidden entrance about 20 feet away from the first. At 6 feet tall I am definitely not built for climbing around in these tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole Cu Chi area really gave you a good sense for what the jungle was like.  Bamboo trees, vines, paths through the trees, lots of overgrown bomb craters.  The only thing missing from the war movies (thankfully!) was pounding rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are links to a couple of videos Jane took of me getting into and leaving the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

The population of Saigon is around seven million people and there are about four million motorbikes. Today we got to be a part of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll spare you the details of our journey to get here, suffice to say that we started by leaving our hotel in Bloomington, MN at 5AM on New Years Day, and we arrived at our hotel in Saigon at 1:05AM on January 3rd.  All of the first and second were a spent in airports on or on planes.  I'm just going to say one time how happy we were to use our American frequent flier miles to upgrade to business class.  Although we may be spoiled for life, and never travel any other way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was our first day of touring with Long, our Saigon guide.  Our tour itinerary said that we were going to have a cultural and culinary experience by motorbike.  For some reason I had a vision in my head of Jane and I sitting side by side in some kind of three wheel arrangement with the driver in front of us.  This was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we met Long this morning in the hotel lobby, he immediately brought us outside and introduced us to his assistant!  Now there are four of us, my vision for the day was changing rapidly.  In the end, we each got a helmet, and hopped on the motor cycle behind them.  Off we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/Jane_motorbike.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stops of the day were the post office, the Catholic cathedral, the Reunification Palace, and the war museum.  I'm still trying to process the war museum, so a post about that will have to wait.  Then lunch at a traditional family Pho restaurant. Beef noodle soup and spring rolls.  Yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the day really got fun when we just toured through the markets on the motorbikes.  We drove down hundreds of narrow streets that no car or tour bus would ever venture down, and we noticed that there is almost nothing you can not carry on the back of a motorbike.  The first thing that caused me to do a double take was a motorbike carrying 50 bags of goldfish!  Then I noticed the man with five 20 liter water bottles balanced.  Next was big plastic tub full of live lobster.  The gallery below has some of our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know some of you are wondering about our sanity.  Arriving in a big city and jumping on the back of a motorbike for a day of touring.  I have to say that I felt like I was not totally safe the entire time.  There is something very interesting about sitting knee to knee with a stranger at a stoplight in a new city that makes you feel like you are getting to know the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning left at a busy intersection is a somewhat intricate dance.  The first thing you do is get in the left lane and drive straight at the oncoming traffic, which magically veers around you as if you were not even there.   Then when you turn left you can do it at almost any time.  My preferred time is when the bus in front of you also turns left and acts as a giant shield.  But it turns out that oncoming traffic slows, and traffic coming from the right also makes way and suddenly you are just going left.  Its kind of like they can all read each others minds and just know when to slow down, when to speed up, and when to merge.  I have some suspicion that this is accomplished by a secret code that is communicated by honking your horn, but I have yet to break the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking to myself how this would never work in America.   Someone would surely run into someone else just to prove the point that they had the right of way.  A day on one corner of riding like this in America would surely beget a thousand lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an inadvertent selfie I got as I was taking a photo as we were driving down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/Saigon/Brad_motorbike.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketplaces we visited are just mind boggling.  Street after street of motorbike parts, electronics, cookware, you name it.  At one stall there were hundreds and hundreds of television remotes.  If you need a replacement, and can find this stall I'm sure they would have just what you need.  I'm not sure how this economy works.  It seems like total chaos to me, but it was clear that people were doing business.  Orders were taken, things were being welded or cut, and things were delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the food marketplace there were thousands of stalls.  Everything was jammed so close together you could hardly walk down the aisles.  The merchants must show about about 5am every morning to lay out their wares, and then put everything away again at the end of the night.  Some stalls are so specialized you can't imagine that they could possibly make it, but there they are, taking orders on their phones, doing their books, and scooping out things to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day we sent off two more loaded down motorbikes.  Our guides took off carrying our large suitcases.  We had planned to travel light for the rest of our time in Vietnam, and so we will catch up with our bags in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

We've been telling people that Vietnam is right on the way to Malta.  On January 30th our 12 Luther students will join us and move in to one of the three flats in Sliema, just two blocks from this amazing view.  I have to pinch myself just thinking that I'm going to be living on an island in the Mediterranean for five months.&lt;/p&gt;

We will join in the fun, becoming students ourselves for the history of Malta class.  But, after one short week of class we will take them to Rome for four days.  At the end of March we will take them to Morocco for a week, and then the students will have another week to travel on their own.  While they are off enjoying the wonders of Europe Jane and I will be biking through the Andalusia region of Spain.  In May our adventure takes us to Istanbul for a long weekend.   We are hoping to fit in a short trip to Sicily or maybe Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students leave after the first week of June, and then Jane and I will treat ourselves to a cruise beginning in Venice and through the greek isles.  We will end in Istanbul, but quickly join up with a Luther alumni tour hosted by our friends for a few days in Prague.  We may even see our old foreign exchange student Cenek!  From Prague we fly home, exhausted, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at our preparatory piles as we begin to organize and pack for the big odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="/images/packing.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas gifts are travel-related this year, versatile clothes, shoes, and camera gadgets, as we anticipate the experiences of the next six months.  Most of them are going directly into the suitcase rather than under the tree.  We are really looking forward to this opportunity to immerse ourselves in a new culture in a way that you cannot do by being a tourist for a few weeks.  Watch this blog, as I will be writing about our journey here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many may say, ooh! you shouldn't be writing about this people will read this and break in.  Well, I can't not document this incredible journey.  And I have six words for the would-be breaker inners.  Home Security, Web Cams, House Sitter.  We are covered.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday we got the true spring skiing experience.  It was cool and crusty in the morning and a bit slushy in the afternoon.  Its been a pretty bad winter here in Tahoe so a lot of the runs were not accessible.  In the morning we went up the Stagecoach express and turned left, to try the Stagecoach run.  It was the worst skiing I have ever experienced in my life.  Thankfully, we learned the trick.  Stay on the groomed runs!  Once we figured that out the day was a blast, if a bit repetitive.  One thing you can't beat is the views.  Bright sunny day, clear blue sky, good friends to ski with.  What could be better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love this photo for all of the layers.  High clouds, low clouds, shadows of clouds on the brown/green valley floor below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the winds kicked in, and the snow came down.  Up to eight inches in the higher elevations.  This made for a second day of mid-winter like skiing.  Suddenly, all the runs that were not good yesterday were very ski-able with a fresh layer of snow.  The only downside was that the winds and snow continued.  We were told in the morning that all the lifts might have to shut down, at some point because thunder (and lightning) were in the forecast for the day.  I've never thought about being up on a ski lift in a thunderstorm before but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, if they do shut down certain of the lifts, then you are in trouble anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess, after all of the Chardonnay I've consumed, and I have consumed my share over the years, I have never really got the "buttery oaky Chardonnay" thing.  Butter is just not something I've ever tasted in my Chardonnay, despite the fact that one of my all time favorites is Rombaur, which according to more than one person in Napa, is the "poster child" for buttery oaky Chardonnays. Really, who wants their Chardonnay to taste like butter?  The whole describing wine thing is another thing I find really interesting.  One of the tasting room hosts, recommended the movie &lt;em&gt;Somm&lt;/em&gt; to us as we were chatting.  I see you can get/rent it on iTunes, so I'm adding that to my list.  Its about a group of guys preparing for the master sommelier exam, which may sound a bit dull, but the reviews for it are fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after two days of tastings in Napa its all clear to me now.  The key that helped me understand the difference, and I'm confident I'm now an expert, is Malolactic Fermentation.  The science of it all, unsurprisingly, has stuck in my brain.  Here's a quick summary of more than you ever probably wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malolactic Fermentation is the process of converting Malic Acid (which tastes tart,and citrussy to my mouth) to Lactic Acid which is a much more mellow flavor.  Malolactic fermentation occurs after fermentation and is the result of injecting a particular bacteria into the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="William Hill" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2877/13381848063_83f9dd310c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to each his own, but I can say that I am a fan of Malolactic Fermentation.  Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rombaur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;William Hill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carpe Deim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poseidon's Vineyard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conquering the Tannins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never been able to drink red wine much due to my allergies.  What am I allergic to in red wine?  Tannin is a chemical that comes from the skins, seeds, and stems of the wine.  They are much more prevalent in red wine than in white.  Now according to our host at Chateau Montelena (see also the movie Bottle Shock) I need to develop a resistance to Tannins in order to drink red wine.  The way to do this, according to this would be allergist, is to begin with Pinot Noir, and work my way up from there.  Well it sounds like a project, and I do enjoy a nice glass of Pinot.  So, something to work on.  All in the name of self improvement of course.&lt;/p&gt;

When I left I had 3 bags packed.  One for our trip to Mazatlan to celebrate the new year with our friends the Vermace's.  One for my January term class on the west coast, and finally a bag full of ski gear for the rest and relaxation trip to Breckenridge.  Since leaving home I have travelled a bit over 10,000 miles.  My means of travel has included several flights, two long train trips on Amtrak, some time in a car, and lots of time on public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 35 days I've had more experiences than many people would have in a lifetime.  I say this out of a sense of gratitude, and to remind myself how lucky I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've body surfed in the Pacific Ocean on the beach in front of our rented house in Mazatlan called the Sand Castle.  Calling the Sand Castle a house is a bit of an understatement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/BodySurf.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/MazGroup.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been deep sea fishing, and reeled in a large Dorado (Mahi Mahi), which was cleaned dockside, and prepared on the grill at the Sand Castle just hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've toasted the New Year watching fireworks over the beach from the fourth floor of the Sand Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/MazNY.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten to know a group of 11 Luther Students well, and watched as they talked with and learned from some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had four days in Seattle to visit Pike Place Market, eat seafood, visit Pioneer Square.  During the same period we visited Amazon, Microsoft, VMWare, and Percognate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amtrak from Seattle to San Francisco promised spectacular views and a comfortable ride.  While the ride was comfortable, if I did it again, I would definitely spring for sleeper cars for the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had four days on Fisherman's Wharf, led a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, and beyond Suasalito.  While in San Francisco we visited Strava, Pinterest, Moovweb, Bizo, Sqwiggle, Schwartz MSL, and Hummer Winblad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary3.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary4.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary5.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've had four days in Menlo Park, including a 32 mile bike ride up Old La Honda road and along Skyline drive.  I introduced the group to turkish food at Sultana restaurant.  While in Menlo Park we spent a day at Google, a morning at SportVision, and learned about patent law at Fenwick West.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary7.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary8.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary9.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary10.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary11.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary12.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The train ride from San Jose to Los Angeles lived up to its billing.  The views were spectacular, and we got to see an amazing sunset over the Pacific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary13.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cap off our trip we stayed in a house called Beethoven's Trio in Santa Monica.  Rather than eating out we were able to use the grill and the kitchen and prepare our own communal meals.  It was fun to watch the students cook (and clean up) and eat in a very casual setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to spend the weekend exploring Venice Beach and anything else in the LA area.  Sunday morning I met a group of Chelsea fans at a local British pub.  A fun way to get my soccer fix for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Santa Monica we visited with Capsule, Coloft, and Fullscreen.  At Fullscreen we were hosted by three Luther alumni two of whom took the Entrepreneurship course and did the journey three four years ago.  It is so gratifying to see your students succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary14.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary15.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally I've been able to spend six days "recuperating" in Breckenridge.  Some might say that five days of skiing is hardly recuperating, and I would agree.  However, we have had 30+ inches of fresh snow in the last three days, and the locals say this is one of the greatest storms ever.  So to say that the skiing has been fantastic is a bit of an understatement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/Breck1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/Breck2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/Breck3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, perhaps the best thing is that I get to go home tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>on 14 inches of powder</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/on-14-inches-of-powder.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-30T15:45:02-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-30T15:45:02-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-30:/PelicanBlog/on-14-inches-of-powder.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The weather report said we had 6 inches of snow overnight.

&lt;p&gt;We were on the third chair up at 8:30 this morning.  The steep parts of the hill were awesome, with powder over my knees, floating through the snow.  On the gentle parts of the hill we all formed a single file line in order to get through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-day it was work.  The powder had been packed in many places and it was work to get through it.  The snow continued heavily throughout the day, and we are supposed to get another 14 inches overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the perfect few days of rest and relaxation to finish off January term.  Its even better because we bought the Epic local passes this year, which means we don't feel like we have to ski full time, but can actually just ski until we are ready to take a break, and then ski again later.  Its been great.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>final visits</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/final-visits.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-25T16:29:17-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-25T16:29:17-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-25:/PelicanBlog/final-visits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My daughter Kaia is getting married next summer.

This is not new news, the proposal was made an accepted last June.  But planning is in full swing now, and I was kind of excited when secured a visit with Capsule, because capsule provides a service where all the guests at your wedding can download the capsule app and it will automatically upload all the photos to a special page for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company was founded by Cyrus, who set out to solve a simple problem, a problem we've been coping with on this course as well.  When you travel, how do you share all your digital photos with the buddies you are traveling with.  When you have a big party?  When you have a wedding, bachelor party, bachelorette party?  Capsule has solved this in a nice, elegant way.  All the photos uploaded for a particular event, are shared with the participants in the event.  Its that easy.  No need to bore all of your Facebook followers with every photo from your trip.  If you're an Instagram user, its super easy to add a special hashtag to your photo and it will be automatically imported into Capsule as well as shared on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was incredibly interesting for me was to listen to Cyrus talk about business models, and monetizing the service.  Cyrus is not a CS guy, he's a business guy.  Of course as an entrepreneur he can talk the tech talk but his home is on the business side.  Here's an example of how differently we tech people approach a problem than the business guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Each event needs to have a unique id, that can be given to the participants to use to join the event, and/or tag their Instagram photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Ha, this is easy, we'll just allow people to pick a unique identifier, lets say &lt;code&gt;#TannerAndKaia&lt;/code&gt; No problem, this is easy just give them a text entry box, and a quick database lookup to make sure the hashtag hasn't already been taken.  No big deal, even an intern could code this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Guy Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;  Ok, just generate a random hashtag &lt;code&gt;#JK286TJ&lt;/code&gt;.  Now if the bride and the groom want to have a nice hashtag for their wedding, we can sell them that as a strategy to monetize the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant!  We tech guys get so focused on the solution most of the time that we never stop to think about simple strategies to monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second visit of the day was to &lt;a href="http://fullscreen.net" title="Fullscreen"&gt;Fullscreen&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a Culver City company that employs three Luther Alumni!  Two of which I am very proud to say are also alumni of this very course.  Drew is employee number 3 of Fullscreen, and Aaron is number 15, Jacob is not far after Aaron.  Fullscreen now numbers over 220 employees, and is a very fast growing new media company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do they do?  What do you mean new media company?  Well, this is where my age really starts to show.  Apparently there are people in this world that spend a lot of time watching "shows" on youTube.  Shows like that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles" title="JennaMarbles"&gt;Marbles girl&lt;/a&gt;, or teenagegirl14, and thousands of others.  As Aaron said, this is not your demographic Brad, this is targeted at a group of people that will probably never pay a cable bill.  So Fullscreen is a Network in the sense that they aggregate all kinds of these new generation entertainers, and help them monetize their videos on youtube.  Note that monetize is a euphemism for ad serving, but thats really only a small part of what Fullscreen is about.  Its a great company and Drew, Aaron, and Jacob were excellent hosts.  They even talked their CEO into spending about an hour with us answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting story around Fullscreen is that Drew and George (CEO of Fullscreen) met at Coloft Santa Monica.  We were also lucky enough to meet with the founder of Coloft, Avesta, (@avestar). He gave the students  a great no-nonsense talk on his views of entrepreneurship. The story of Drew meeting George is a great example of the synergies that can happen in a co-working facility.  At the time, Drew and a partner were trying to start a little consulting company to do coding for hire.  Avesta happened to be talking to George who was looking for someone with Drew's skill set.  So he introduced the two of them, and a successful company was launched.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this story on a couple of different levels.  First, as a professor I take pride in the success and accomplishments of my students even after they leave the campus.  As an alum and faculty member of a college that counts community as one of its defining characteristics, it is great to find other organizations that lift up community as a differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>applied math and physics</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/applied-math-and-physics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-22T10:38:12-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-22T10:38:12-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-22:/PelicanBlog/applied-math-and-physics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know those yellow lines on the football field?

They are harder to draw than they look.  Think for a minute about all of the different field conditions.  Natural green turf, artificial turf, mud, snow, cold brown grass.  Now think about all of the different colored uniforms the players wear.  Now, look closely.  The line never covers up any part of a player, or the ball.  Notice that?  The ball doesn't have a yellow strip, the ball blocks out the yellow line.  The same with players shoes.  Today we got to learn about the yellow lines, the blue lines, the down and distance information,  and many more cool effects that Sportvision puts on our television screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SportVision" src="/images/JTerm14/SportVision2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the group on the "practice Field"  They were moving the blue and the yellow line for us as we stood there. You can kind of see them on the big screen on the wall.  The rack of equipment behind me is what they need to bring to each game, and the computers on the desk are whats used by the operator during the game.  The operator can adjust all sorts of parameters based on field conditions and uniform colors etc.  In addition, in the case of a really bad snow storm, they can also project all the yard markers on top of the snow so the people at home have a better view of the field than the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to football, Sportvision is also a big provider of on screen information for NASCAR and Major League Baseball.  In the case of NASCAR they display a box of statistics right above the car as it goes around the track.  For Major League Baseball, they show the ball and strike zone, and a bunch of statistics about pitch placement.  They also collect statistics about every player on the diamond.  They track the ball and the players using an array of cameras placed around the ballpark.  Here's where the cool math and physics comes in.  Based on the flight of the ball, they compute the spin!  The cameras are not good enough yet to track the laces, but with some math, they can provide a visualization of how the ball is spinning!  Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sportvision is looking at lots of sports, and looking at newer ways to get more information about every player.  For example Football players may have special chips embedded in their shoulder pads someday in the future.  NASCAR cars already have a special box in them that tracks all kinds of information for Sportvision, Soccer players are not likely to have any special chips as it would likely inhibit their play, unless something could be put in their shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SportVision" src="/images/JTerm14/SportVision1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most of the companies we have met with Big Data is an important part of Sportvision's  future plans.  Right now their main customers are the television networks, but in the future individual teams will pay for data.  One interesting aspect of the big data strategy for Sportvision is that they don't have to productize the analytics part of it. The reason is because most teams just want the data, and they consider the analytics to be a competitive advantage.  This doesn't mean that Sportvision won't productize some analysis software, because there is a market at the college level and below where teams can't afford to pay for their own data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category></entry><entry><title>transportation cogitation</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/transportation-cogitation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-20T19:28:44-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-20T19:28:44-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-20:/PelicanBlog/transportation-cogitation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a post I've been thinking about for a few days.

Its a serious post, but especially after today, its surrounded in humor.  Here's the problem, to me this is funny, but if you had to live with it every day of your life, it might not be funny.
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking about this goes all the way back to the first day of JTerm, when we walked, and walked, and walked... through miles of parking garage to get to the light rail that would take us downtown.  When we arrived downtown, most of us could easily take the escalator conveniently up to street level.  Where we hunted around for the elevator for the rest of the group.  It turns out the elevator is never in a location that is convenient or close to the escalators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I led the group into a coffee shop (not a Starbucks) that our host had recommended.  I popped in, looked around, and quickly realized that we couldn't stay, not only couldn't we stay we couldn't all get in the coffee shop.  Stairs only, no ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, the Seattle bus drivers were all extremely knowledgeable and courteous.  They were able to quickly help get everyone on the bus, and locked into place for a safe ride, without one word of complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ride from Seattle to San Francisco was 23 hours.  It was uncomfortable for most of us, especially when trying to sleep, but it had to be sheer torture for someone who couldn't get out of their chair for the entire time.  Things started to get humorous when we got on the bus outside the Amtrak station.  It was like the driver had no idea how to operate the wheelchair lift!  Hey lets just press some of these buttons and see what happens.  Never mind, the picture diagram of what to do that was posted right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we needed to use the super shuttle to go from San Francisco to Menlo Park, things got a lot worse.  First, the super shuttle has yet to be on time.  Second, even though we ordered an accessible van, the drivers once again clearly had no idea how to make it work.  Luckily by this time our own guys had figured out the general principles of a lift and were able to quickly give useful advice.  The real shocker was our bus from First Student.  All jokes about being on the short bus aside, it blew me away that the driver showed up with a non-functional lift.  He said the battery was dead, but that didn't stop him from randomly pressing buttons while our crew figured out how to operate the lift manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lift Operator" src="/images/JTerm14/LiftOperator.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its been an interesting process of learning and discovery on our travels, learning to look for ramps and elevators.  Learning to avoid crappy rocky roads whenever possible, and generally feeling a small part of the pain of a comrade that has to put up with this stuff every day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category></entry><entry><title>the social implications of a self-driving car</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-googeley-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-18T10:40:14-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-18T10:40:14-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-18:/PelicanBlog/a-googeley-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we moved south, from Fisherman's wharf down to Menlo Park.

But most of the day was spent at Google.  This was certainly a day that everyone has been looking forward to for most of the trip.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest in Google+ was renewed by a great tech talk by Ed Chi.  Who said some very nice things about me in front of my students.  They probably think I paid him.  We heard about supporting an organization as large as Google from Luther Alum Charles Banta, and about i18n -- i(nternationalizatio)n from Luther Alum and former CS faculty member Craig Cornelius.  Yes there are 18 letters between the parenthesis!  We had a fabulous tour of campus, a stop in the 3D printer lab, time at the gift shop, and of course, lunch at Charlie's Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard about Google's famous slides, but they also have fire poles for people that want to quickly get down a floor.  And, in case you don't want to walk between buildings they have these cool Google Bikes all over the place.  Guests are encouraged not to ride the bikes, but nobody said anything about posing with one for your picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Bike" src="/images/JTerm14/GoogleBike.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other talk we heard was from Brian, a member of the self driving car project, who gave us a quick overview of the Google X Chauffeur Project.  The technology is interesting, and I have to admit I hadn't really thought past the cool sensors, and modeling that would be required.  But, what is even more interesting are the many social implications of self driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian pointed out a couple of interesting facts for us to consider.  Most people dedicate more space in their homes to their car or cars than they do to their own children's living space.  He also asked us to think about all the cars in the parking lot outside the office we were in.  What fraction of the time are those cars in use?  Are they parked 90% of the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if our self driving cars could take the kids to school in the morning, and then return a while later to bring us to work?  What if we could just bring up our smart phone and request a self driving car to pick us up at work and drop us off at home.  We might not need such large garages.  Could we turn much of our driveway space into gardens?  Would this mean the end of rush hour?  Probably not, but if the car was self driving, could a self driving car pick up you and a couple of friends on a logical path to work and drop you off?  On the freeways would traffic flow more fluidly if the cars could talk to each other and the automated sensor systems were good enough to ensure a nice safe drive with cars spaced out 10 feet apart?  A self driving car has no need to slow down and gawk if there is an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lexus" src="/images/JTerm14/lexus.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would we collectively own fewer vehicles if our car could be called to pick us up with the touch of a button on our smart phone, or automatically scheduled to pick us up based on our daily calendar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big car companies will say that self driving cars are 30 years in the future.  The researchers at Google feel like we are more like 5-10 years from reality.  Who is better situated to make that call?  The companies with the navigational, and sensor technology, with access to smart phone interfaces and calendars?  In short a company like Google?  Personally, I'm rooting for Google on this one, and can't wait to buy into my first self driving car collective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>a lesson in venture capital</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-lesson-in-venture-capital.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-17T11:13:15-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-17T11:13:15-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-17:/PelicanBlog/a-lesson-in-venture-capital.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Ann is on a roll, we are going to be late."

Ann Winblad was the first investor in my Company, Net Perceptions, back in 1996.  She was an investor, a  mentor, and a supporter of us for years.  Today she was giving my students a lesson in the new economics and ecosystems of software development.  &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was taking notes as fast as I could to keep up with the stream of new companies and technologies that were &lt;em&gt;must know&lt;/em&gt; things according to Ann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lesson she opened up the floor to questions, and the stories began to flow.  And flow, and when the students stopped asking questions she asked them questions and told them stories about their answers.  We were long past the end of our scheduled time, and I noticed her long term assistant Katie, standing across the room arms folded, glaring at Ann.  Heaven only knows what poor entrepreneur was downstairs sweating while she was entertaining us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ann repeated a number of themes we've heard throughout the trip.  One I don't think I've mentioned here but we have heard from several people:  &lt;strong&gt;Don't sweat your first job.&lt;/strong&gt; or Your first job is just your first job, so don't worry about it too much.  This is such a change from when I graduated from college, and I think its a real shock for midwestern students to hear.  But I think it is true.  We tend to think of that fist job as a real important commitment whereas the truth is it is a chance to get experience for 2-3 years and then to help you really decide your direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I'm not sure I agree with is Ann's assertion that 90% of sofware will be assembled from already existing components.  This may be true for some companies, but it seems to me that &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;, breakthroughs are still going to come from creating new and innovative components for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is continuing a trend/theme that we have picked up on in this trip, but that may also be a bit troubling.  1.  It is so much cheaper for a software company to get off the ground these days.  Amazon AWS, is just one contributor to this, Sonatype is another.  2. Automated sales and marketing software is yet another.  Gone are the days when you need a big face to face sales force to sell enterprise software. 3. The result of this is that VC's are able to make bets on software companies for a relatively small amount of money.  The downside is that they may not be investing in the riskier, bigger companies that may result in really big breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my own, and your convenience, here is a list of words of wisdom and interesting companies to check out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to know Atlassian, Github, and Sonatype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about &lt;em&gt;Engagement Moments&lt;/em&gt; These are the times that people are really paying attention to their devices and are good times to hit them up with an ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn Hadooop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing SQL is a requirement for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plumgrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hortonworks&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Changing the World: Understanding Entrepreneurship, January 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been so glad to leave Minnesota as I was on January 6th.  The temperature outside was -24 with a windchill that defied all logic.  I was headed for Seattle with 11 Luther students to begin my course on "Understanding Entrepreneurship."  I really enjoy traveling with students.  Their energy, their enthusiasm, their ability to eat a &lt;em&gt;doughnut burger&lt;/em&gt; at the airport before getting on a three hour flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our itinerary for the three-week course includes four days in Seattle, an overnight train ride, six days in San Francisco, four days in Silicon Valley, a continuation of the train ride to Las Angeles where we will conclude the trip.  Notice the nice progression of temperatures, from -24 in Minneapolis to 48 in Seattle to 68 here in San Francisco today, to even warmer in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of the course are for the students to meet with people from a variety of companies, from early stage startups to very successful large companies, and everything in between.  We’ll meet with technology companies, Venture Capitalists, Public Relations folks, managers, programmers, you name it.  The point is for the students to hear stories.  Sometimes the most interesting and valuable stories are the stories about failure.  Sometimes they are about success.  Almost always they are a combination of the two that demonstrate passion, persistence, and the willingness to take a risk.  The students are from a variety of majors including CS, management, accounting, marketing, and communications.The mix of majors creates good discussion, and questions from a variety of perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies we have visited you have probably heard of:  Microsoft, Pinterest, Google, and Amazon. Many of the people we have talked to at those companies are veterans of smaller companies that have ended up in a large company.  Some of the companies we have visited you maybe haven't heard of, and may never hear of:  Sqwiggle, Moovweb, Strava, Capsule, and Fullscreen.  Some of these smaller companies are still in the "garage phase," they are just a couple of people with a great idea and a huge amount of passion to change the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have connections to many of these companies from my former life as a software entrepreneur, but what is even more exciting is that I am connected to some of these companies by former students, and other Luther Alums.  What a great experience it is for the students to see Luther Alumni, here on the west coast, doing great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dan and John, Two smart guys" src="/images/JTerm14/Pinterest.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students all have their own reasons for taking the course.  Some want to see if the West coast is right for them. Some want to learn about the different job opportunities in the high tech area. Some are exploring.  Some are looking for an internship for next summer at that one cool company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the passion, and the willingness to take a risk on something you believe in that I really hope they take away from this course.  Too often, our Lutheran midwest culture teaches us that failure is bad, something to be ashamed of.  What they hear in Silicon Valley is that not trying is far worse.  Everyone here has stories about failing.  One, two, three or more startups that never made it.  The reasons are as varied as the people.  Something like 90% of newly started companies are not successful.  But, people learn from their mistakes, move on, and do something new, sometimes they do something great.  Always, they are trying to make a difference.  If they learn nothing more than that, the course will be a success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>there is no cure for curiosity</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/there-is-no-cure-for-curiosity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-14T08:07:07-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-14T08:07:07-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-14:/PelicanBlog/there-is-no-cure-for-curiosity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is the cure for boredom.

We began our day with a visit to PR firm, Schwartz MSL, Bryan Scanlon gave the group a great overview of the players in the PR space and how PR companies work.   The tagline for their group may be something like "telling stories that matter." I like this and it resonates well with a lot of the career advice people are sharing with the students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact Bryan told a great story about his brother that really helped emphasize the message that you have to find a real world outlet for your skills and then use your skills to develop something real, something that you can tell a story about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan's story was that at an interview for an engineering job his brother was asked to glue together two PVC pipes.  A pretty practical, maybe even mundane, task for someone applying for an engineering job.  However his brother took stock of the situation and said he couldn't do it.  "Why not?" asked the interviewer.  "You don't have any cleaning fluid" was the reply, "without cleaning fluid I can't do a proper job and the joint won't last."  He was hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch time was great as Gage, Dylan, and I went to an Irish pub called Irish Times.  The outstanding feature of this pub is that they had the Arsenal game on all of the TVs during lunch today.  The arsenal were taking on Aston Villa, in a game we needed to win to retake "top of the table."  In a stroke of good luck I got to see both Arsenal goals before we had to take off for our afternoon meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon meeting was at Hatch Today, a co-working space that houses many many small companies.  We visited for over an hour with Eric, one of the co-founders of Sqwiggle.  Eric is young, energetic, has a thousand side projects going, and is the epitome of young founders here in the area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software that sqwiggle produces is somewhat like Google Hangouts, but the video is only in black and white and only updates every 10 seconds, unless you are actively in a conversation with a co-worker.  The idea is you can have sqwiggle on all day, without using a ton of bandwidth, and your fellow workers can see when you are in your office.  If they need to have a quick conversation, they just double click on you.  This allows for good interaction in a company that is totally distributed.  Sqwiggle is a great example of such a company.  One founder is in the UK, one in San Francisco, and one of their developers is Luther alum Cam Webb, currently in Atlanta, but soon to move to Des Moines.  I think many of us were skeptical of the idea until we met with Eric, saw it in action, and learned a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the themes we've been hearing about were repeated by Eric this afternoon, but I would like to highlight one that has not been mentioned yet.  &lt;strong&gt;Measurement&lt;/strong&gt;  Eric showed us the company dashboard.  Very cool, how many user, how many paying users, how many active users, revenue per month.  All great metrics to run the business by.  In addition he talked about other metrics they are collecting relative to the details of the software.  This is a really important lesson.  If you want to really improve something, you need to measure it.  For example, bandwidth usage, number of active users in a conversation, you need to set goals, and then work on designing your software to meet those goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category></entry><entry><title>student blogs</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/student-blogs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-13T16:35:04-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-13T16:35:04-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-13:/PelicanBlog/student-blogs.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few people have asked for the links to the students blogs.

We rented some bikes at Blazing Saddles, right next to the hotel.  Then took off for the golden gate bridge.  It was a beautiful day and no surprise, the bike paths were very crowded with all kinds of people enjoying the outdoors and the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/GoldenBike1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of the group above rode across the bridge and back.  Here is me leading the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/GoldenBike2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half followed me further on into Sausalito, with the goal of making it to Muir Woods.  The second half of the trek started off very nicely with a long downhill.  which was quickly followed by a steep uphill.  All well and good until my riders started to figure out that "what goes down must be climbed back up!"  The ride flattened out through Sausalito and beyond so it was a nice easy ride for a while.  But it was getting to noon, and we'd already ridden about 12 miles.  I misunderstood the directions from the bike shop and thought we had about 12 more to go.  So, since the guys all had tickets to Alcatraz and had to be ready to board by about 3:30 we decided to turn back short of our goal.  It turns out we were much closer and could have made it to the redwoods!  Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we rode just over 25 miles, and it sure felt good to be on a bike outside again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="jterm14"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>the starlight coastal</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-starlight-coastal.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-10T17:47:25-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-10T17:47:25-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-10:/PelicanBlog/the-starlight-coastal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A 23 hour train trip?

There is no real way to know the answer to this question, but it is one that was posed to the group today.  How do you handle uncertainty?  How do well do you think on your feet?  This is a typical interview question used by many high tech companies.  At Luther we might ask prospective faculty, "how many cornstalks in the state of Iowa?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question definitely stumped a few people in the room, but others got the idea quickly.  This question isn't about getting the right answer.  There is a right answer, but nobody could tell you exactly what it is.  There is definitely a wrong answer:  "I don't know," or "Its not possible." are two examples of the wrong answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do?  You have to make some assumptions.  What fraction of the state of Washington is forested, what is the density of trees in the forested area.  If you use some reasonable numbers for those two items you can make a reasonable, and defensible estimate.  That is something that startups have to do every day.  Use the information they have available, and make their best guess.  Check the assumptions, and be ready to refine the answer.  This is not just true of startups, it is true for all businesses, projects, and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more highlights and themes from today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you interview, have a story.  I've been telling my students this for the last several years, but it is much more compelling when you hear it from someone who is actually making hiring decisions.  The story should be based around something you have built or designed yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can have the best technology and still fail in many different ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the one core competency of your company?  Starbucks was not coffee, it was training, so that customers had a consistent experience.  McDonalds was not making burgers, but rather distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, it takes four kinds of people to make a successful startup:  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Visionary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Builder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Closer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person may take on multiple of these roles, but you have to have them all in order to be successful as a company.  The Visionary is of course the person who is looking ahead five years and setting the direction.  The Builder, owns the solution space.  Builders are part of a spectrum.  Architects -- Hackers.  Architects want to have a good strong lasting implementation, and tend to plan the whole system out before coding.  Hackers, tend to code as they think, and the best of them have an idea coded by the end of the meeting where it was first introduced.  Where are you on that spectrum?  The Designers interpret the vision to the builders, they own the problem space, and understand the user experience.  In the best case, the builder and the designer are the same person.  Finally, the Closer, usually a sales person, often also the CEO is the person who can close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The better a company is at serving their customers, the less likely the are to change.  This of course goes against every lesson Steve Jobs and others like him taught us.  You need to make yourself obsolete before someone else does.  In an aside, I think this lesson right here is the achilles heel of higher education.&lt;/li&gt;

He recently observed that we are so early in Day One that the alarm clock hasn't even gone off yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new technologies, it’s very tempting to think that you’re further along than you are. But usually, you’re more primitive than you think. My guess is we’re still pretty primitive. We as a society, as a civilization. I doubt we have figured out the new technologies very well yet. At Amazon, we’re doing our part in trying to push things forward, but I have the feeling it’s Day One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was that we found ourselves in the building called Day One South, meeting with our very gracious host Sam. This was a great way to start, and although Sam had not been prompted in any way about what to say, he hit on some of key themes for the students to take away from the course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion&lt;/strong&gt; -- You are going to work long hours, so you want to find a place to work and a job to do at that place where you are passionate about whatever it is.  If you aren't excited about it, keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture&lt;/strong&gt; -- This part of the discussion brought back both great memories and ulcers in my stomach from the days when Amazon was a Net Perceptions customer.  I've never been pushed harder than I was by Jennifer Jacobi (JJ) when she was my primary contact at Amazon.  She challenged us, held our feet to the fire, threatened to dump us, and ultimately helped us create a better product.  Apparently this is how Amazon treats all its suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt; -- High tech companies are full of risk takers.  Sam was no exception as a young graduate who simply moved to Seattle in search of a job.  Years later he is still at Amazon.  Many more years later than he expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/JTerm14/Amazon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our meeting with Amazon we found a coffee shop where we could take over a large table and had some group discussion.  I told my own story of Net Perceptions, which I should probably write down here soon, and tried to relate my own experience with the themes I want the students to look for over the next three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>envisioning the future</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/envisioning-the-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-08T12:38:25-06:00</published><updated>2014-01-08T12:38:25-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2014-01-08:/PelicanBlog/envisioning-the-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was a big day.

&lt;p&gt;We began our visit with an hour in the Envisioning Center, this is Microsoft's take on the future, 5 years out.  There was some pretty cool stuff in there.  If you've ever drooled over the fancy table on Hawaii Five-O where they can flick things from phone to table, table to screen, etc. You have a pretty good idea of where Microsoft thinks the workplace of the future is headed.  I'm there, I want it.  I'm already imagining myself walking into the classroom, iPad in hand, and flicking a copy of where we left off last class from my iPad to the board.  Wait, thats a bit of a mixed vision, I'm pretty sure they were surface pads, not iPads.  But you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Envisioning center we moved to another of the 128 buildings on the Microsoft campus where we had time to have our daily group meeting and book presentation.  We were escorted by Tina Wang, and she joined in to the discussion of Sara Lacy's Once you're Lucky, Twice you're good.  Tina works as part of Enwe's group, but is the only one here in the US.  After our lunch we had a really fun talk with Neil Leslie, who shared a lot of wisdom with the group.  And finally Dave Maltz joined us for a final hour on scaling up the data center.  Its fair to say that by the time Dave was done everyone had soaked up about as much information as is possible for brain to take in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple observations.  This is not the Microsoft of the 90's.  The Microsoft that I knew and worked with at Net Perceptions were, well, to be blunt, they were bullies back then, because they could be.  I get a real sense that is gone.  Instead they talk of change, how they need to compete, and if you're comfortable, you shouldn't be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to key themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion:  I don't think I need to say more about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects:  I've told my seniors this for a few years now, but it has a lot more credibility coming from an outsider.  You need to have a project to show when you go to interview.  Bring an app you have built on your phone.  Show a website you have developed on the browser.  Be prepared to talk about the challenges, trade-offs, and succeesses you have had in developing your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linked In:  This is a critical tool for finding a job.  If you are a CS junior or senior and have not created a LinkedIn profile.  Do it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure:  We heard a lot of stories about failure today, and we will continue to hear of them.  Startups, started and 'buried,' products and projects that failed and never saw the light of day.  The most important message, that I hope students get from this trip, and talking to a bunch of successful people, is that failure is OK.  &lt;strong&gt;Fail Fast&lt;/strong&gt;, and learn from your mistakes.  It is a cliche to say that you learn more from failure than success, but it is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening it was fun to unwind with our first group dinner.  We met up with recent Luther Alum Jake Nowosatka at Cutters Crabhouse.  Its at the far end of Pike Place Market.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, with the airing of last nights episode of Top Chef the story can now be told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were on the set for the filming of the Quickfire challenge onboard the ship!  Although the filming took several hours, we got less than 1 second of screen time.  But here we are!  Brian and I happened to be in a pretty good spot as the camera flashes past us several times.  The ladies we were talking to turned out to be from Wisconsin, in fact from right by our cabin!  The two in the print shirts actually got an additional 2 seconds of screen time along with their comments on the food.

Jane, Brian, and I all made it on again towards the end of the challenge.  Sadly there is no sign of Holly.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8434428742" title="View 'IMG_0277' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img height="375" title="IMG_0277" alt="IMG_0277" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8355/8434428742_32af448c8b.jpg" width="500"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course since this was all way before the show started we had no idea who any of the chefs really were.  I do remember really liking Sheldon's lettuce cups as well as Stefan's little potato soup cup.  I could swear that I remember seeing Kristin on the ship, so maybe she got to come along since she would be competing in last chance kitchen in Juneau. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm looking forward to the finale.  I'm not sure who I want to win the most, with Stefan and Josie gone all the villains are off the show.  I think it would be awesome if Kristin makes it through LCK and gets to compete against Sheldon or Josh in the Finale.  Thats Josh, by the way, in the first photo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>the debary institute</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-debary-institute.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-01-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2013-01-25:/PelicanBlog/the-debary-institute.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its been a great J-Term.

&lt;p&gt;We arrived on Friday and spent a wonderful late afternoon enjoying the hospitality and home of our host, Tim Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8405885066" title="View 'IMG_0214' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img height="375" title="IMG_0214" alt="IMG_0214" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8405885066_aaa4dd8469.jpg" width="500"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday we toured Stetson University in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8405885966" title="View 'IMG_0221' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img height="500" title="IMG_0221" alt="IMG_0221" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8212/8405885966_564e8ca398.jpg" width="375"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we repaired to Smyrna Beach, it was a bit windy but we enjoyed it all the same.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8404793959" title="View 'IMG_0229' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img height="375" title="IMG_0229" alt="IMG_0229" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8404793959_3faa6ba998.jpg" width="500"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culinary highlight of our trip was dinner at the Swamp House Grill and Tiki Bar.  We enjoyed some lovely alligator bites as appetizers:
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8405887432" title="View 'IMG_0236' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img height="200" title="IMG_0236" alt="IMG_0236" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8405887432_1b8fb2bf27.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  (Yes, as the famous frog said, they do taste like chicken)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we sat around enjoying the music of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/markdmooreoriginals"&gt;Mark Moore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was Football (European and American) and then Golf day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8405887790" title="View 'IMG_0245' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img height="375" title="IMG_0245" alt="IMG_0245" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8516/8405887790_1e84e19b80.jpg" width="500"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner was provided by Gregory and Brad who made a charming seafood alfredo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning we left the house at 5:50AM.   The temperature was 62 degrees.  Five hours later we arrived in Cedar Rapids where the temperature was -2.  Thats a big swing for a monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colorado resorts have a really cool new way of handling the ski passes, instead of clipping a tag on your jacket you now get a credit card with an RFID chip in it.  Talk about a ski pass that appeals to the Geek in me!  But whats even better is that every time you go on a lift, there is an RFID reader that grabs your ID and logs that lift ride.  So now at the end of the day you can go on to a website and see how many vertical feet you skiied that day.  Very cool.  Over our four days of skiing we did just over 95,000 vertical feet!  If we'd only known how close to 100k we would get we surely would have had a shorter lunch break on day one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since snow started late and has been a bit sparse since Christmas there was a lot of snow making going on.  The mounds of snow created by the snow machines remind you of a Dr. Seuss drawing:

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to say that my skiing has really improved thanks to my Solomon BBR 8.9 skis.  I've started to call them my magic skis because I can even do the moguls!  Here's a picture I took of craig at the top of one particularly narrow and moguly run.  Note that I got down first with enough time to turn around and snap some pictures.

&lt;p&gt;Here's another shot of Craig just before he jumped off the cliff.  Note once again who went first to take the picture:   :-)

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great four days of skiing with the guys.

When after more than 27 years as friends, and seven days of traveling together you can play Euchre -- couple against couple -- and still be friends at the end of the train ride from Seward to Anchorage.  Now you might think that a simple card game means nothing, but there a few members of our party of 4 who are a little on the competitive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controversy in this story came after our third missed bear siting on the train.  "There's a bear up ahead on the left side of the train... No now its on the right... no, now its on the left..."  This is some kind of weird plan by the conductor to get the train rocking back and forth, or something to get the people in the back cars of the train to drink more.  So, here it is dear readers, as we are all in a state of frustration over bear sitings, the up card is a heart, I'm holding three diamonds (but no bowers).  Everyone passes, and it comes back around to me.  I bid diamonds.  This is when the trouble starts.  As it turns out, Holly has both red bowers and only passed because she had better diamonds than hearts.  Needless to say we get set, and I launch into some kind of self righteous tirade about "maur passing" just to set us.  This scenario plays itself out three times again over the course of the train ride...  Now last night I might have said some mean words about Holly's card playing ethics, but today in hindsight, and in the spirit of type 2 fun, I can see that I might have been overly harsh in my judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5773054740292003042'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--QmjSY4dcis/UB4Cswf9ZOI/AAAAAAAAAuI/29IDXmbLkyc/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The card playing on the train was the culmination of a long day.  The last day of a cruise is always a long hard day.  For one thing, I think thats one of the things that all cruise lines suck at.  You are an awesome person who must be waited on and pampered at every turn, until the last morning of the cruise.  Then you yesterday's news, who must get up early and off the ship as soon as possible, so your room can be turned over to someone new and wonderful who must be pampered at every turn.   Or maybe I'm just grumpy that I'm not the new wonderful person anymore.  In any case we love cruising and its ability to allow you to see great places in the world, all the while knowing that you have a safe comfortable place to eat and sleep each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent our day on a Kenai Fjord tour.   We had another day of wildlife sitings.  The new animals we saw today included Dahl Porpoises and up close views of Puffins and Stellar Sea Lions.  The tour company was really good, it was Major Marine Tours.  Its not the largest tour company in the marina but the service can't be beat.  When we got out into open ocean areas and the swells got large they were especially kind to the large number of people at the back railing "going for distance."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5773054789764538754'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WzbeE1A-HNE/UB4CvozIYYI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/qVkFepDPMzA/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='400' height='400' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I post this picture of the sea lions -- whose population has been declining for the last several years -- I am reminded of one especially redeeming quality of the day.  SUN!! This is the first day since we left Minneapolis that we've had a sunny day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long day, we arrived at the Anchorage train station at 10:30 PM.  We got our luggage and the hotel shuttle picked us up for our ride to the hotel.  Holly and I transported all of our bags to our room, while Jane and Brian stayed on the shuttle to go to the airport to get our car.  We lucked out on the emerald aisle and got a good sized Dodge.  At least its big enough to hold all of our luggage and all of us.  We had envisioned a number of scenarios in which we stored our luggage at the hotel while we went North to Denali.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this we are in our room in the Mckinley Creekside Cabins.  Its not quite the same as our cabin on board the ship, but as Gabe would say, in Alaska, "Warm and Dry is more than you can hope for"  We had a pretty good drive in the rain to get here, including a swell stop at the liquor store in Wasilla, and some fake pictures of where we imagine Sarah Palin might have lived.  We got our tickets for tomorrows bus tour of Denali and then spent some time visiting with the sled dogs of Denali.  We took the very scenic Rock Creek hiking path back to the visitors center and then headed out to Prospectors Pizza for a delicious meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will be another long day of hiking and bus riding as we go in search of Bear and Moose here in Denali National Park.  We are hoping for another clear day so that we can see Mount McKinley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Alaska&amp;z=10'&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>icy strait / hoonah</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/icy-strait-hoonah.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-08-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-08-02:/PelicanBlog/icy-strait-hoonah.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I mentioned type 3 fun in a previous posting, and although there was plenty of type 1 fun to be had in Icy Strait I'd like to begin this post with a little description of some type 3 fun.

As a reminder, the definition of type 3 fun is something that is lame when you do it, and remains lame and not fun even in the retelling.  Thus was our bike tour of Hoonah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should start out by saying that it is not the fault of the bike tour guide, or anyone else involved with tours at Icy Straits.  We signed up for the bike tour / zip line combination tour through the cruise line because that was the only way we could sign up for a zip line tour in the afternoon.  The idea of an eight mile bike ride sounded appealing, a bike tour is a great way to see an area at a faster pace than walking, and is a nice way to get to know an area better than you do in a tour bus.  but, the simple truth is that Hoonah is a nice small fishing town in Alaska, but there really isn't that much to see.  So, we saw the ferry terminal (3-4 ferries per week), the office bar, the seaplane dock, the library, the post office, and the airport.  Oh yeah, and it was RAINING yes  really really raining.  We were absolutely soaked to the bone through our pants and jackets and everything.  Yuck!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all agreed that what we should have done was just not ride the bikes.  We could have stayed at the visitor center for a while staying warm and dry and then gotten on the bus to the top of the zip line.  Our mistake.  So, yes a wet cold bike ride through a town of 800 is virtually the definition of type 3 fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, lets leave that in the past and talk about the highlights of our day in Icy Strait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began in the morning with our whale watching adventure.  We had booked a small tour with a private operator.   I would highly recommend that everyone does this.  The small boats are so much more nimble, and you get to know some of the local people in a way that you can't when you are on a big boat with 100 other people.   So it happened that there were only six of us on the boat with captain Floyd.  We had plenty of room to spread out and we were not vying for position with other people when the whales showed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As whale watching trips go, this one just couldn't be beat.  We were not even out of the harbor before we were treated to a humpback bubble netting.  Bubble netting is one feeding strategy used by the humpacks.  They circle under the water making tons of bubbles that confuse the smelt to the point where they don't know which way is up.  Then the whale swoops in from below with mouth wide open and scoops up hundreds of gallons of water and fish.  The whale closes its mouth and strains out all the yummy fish through its baleen.  Here's a picture of the first whale we encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5772201170222499842'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OifYXuv-7IQ/UBr6YcM0yAI/AAAAAAAAAtc/raUOXRCW-io/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, of course, anyone who has ever been on a whale watching trip has seen lots of whale tails.  As the humpbacks typically come up, show their hump for a while, and then dive deep.  When they dive deep they do so with their tail straight up in the air.  What most people do not get the opportunity to see first hand is a humpback breaching.  This is when the whale propels its whole body out of the water.  This is an amazing feet for an animal that averages 40 feet in length and weighs about 1000 pounds per foot of length!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5772201228003321314'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NLYwtiSx1xw/UBr6bzc2JeI/AAAAAAAAAtk/eHT2vUkj01c/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='400' height='400' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were lucky enough to see several such breaches.  I was lucky enough to have my camera pointed in the right direction when this one happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we were in for one more bonus.  Orcas!  Its pretty rare to get to see Orcas on a whale watching trip!  After watching the humpbacks for a while our captain informed us that there were Orcas in the area.  This is another great example of the benefit of going on a smaller ship.  The captain can just take off and follow the whales you want to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5772201284964585906'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BMXR--caUPo/UBr6fHpeEbI/AAAAAAAAAts/92AveghNBZE/s288/2.jpg' border='0' width='400' height='400' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are two Orcas from the small pod we were following.  For a while we thought we were going to see the death of one of the sea lions swimming perilously close to this group, but I guess they were not hungry at the time.  The dorsal fin in the picture above is about six feet tall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the whale watching was awesome, but our final act of the day was also a  real blast.  The worlds longest, highest, fastest zip line!  Its a one shot ride from the top of the mountain outside of hoonah, down to sea level.  This was  really a stretch for Holly, who is a not a lover of heights, but the ride was fun.  Unlike other zip lines, this one actually has a harness that allows you to sit quite comfortably.  You don't have any brakes to worry about as that is taken care of for you at the bottom by Physics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the top of the zip line you brace your feet against the starting gate, six people at a time, and then they count down from three.  The gates open and you are off.  In our case we started out in the clouds, flying downward.  Suddenly you are out of the clouds and the ship and the water all come into beautiful view right in front of your eyes.  In just about 90 seconds the ride is over, but its a real thrill.  I've got some great video from the head mounted camera, but I'll have to wait until I get home to edit that and post it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Hoonah,%20AK&amp;z=10'&gt;Hoonah, AK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>type 2 fun</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/type-2-fun.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-08-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-08-01:/PelicanBlog/type-2-fun.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our guide for the Mendenhall glacier trek told us that there are 3 kinds of fun.

Type 1 fun, is just "fun fun."  Its good while its happening and afterward you remember it as fun.  Type 2 fun is the kind of thing where you do something and even though you might be totally exhausted or in pain when its all over you remember it later as being an awesome thing to do.  Type 3 fun, is no fun at all, it sucks when you do it and it doesn't get any better in your memory over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was all about Type 2 fun. Today was 8 hours of hiking, rock scrabbling, and walking on the glacier.  The last two and a half hours of hiking were in pouring rain.  But already, just one day later we are remembering yesterday as an awesome day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the ship at 8:15AM to meet our guide, Gabe, who drove us out to the trail head.  Gabe had backpacks for us with our glacier gear in them, a hiking pick axe, a helmet, a harness, and crampons.  Also some light snacks.  We were in our Alaskan layers of Dry Fit, Kuhl Fleece, and North Face.  To this we added rain pants and a rain jacket.  There was a light rain falling at the beginning of our hike, but that stopped somewhere along the way.  The hike starts out pretty easy, and gets gradually more difficult the closer you get to the glacier.  There was one point where we were truly climbing up the rocks next to a small waterfall.  It was great, but it wasn't easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a half a mile, people were stopping to shed layers of clothing like crazy.  We continued this process for a good portion of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two and a half hours of hiking and climbing over rocks we were really getting close to the glacier.  With Gabe's help we did some estimating on where the glacier would have been the last time we were in Alaska.  It was really interesting to take a picture from that point and to see how far it has receded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took a short break to get our glacier gear unpacked and to gear up for our trek on the glacier itself. About this time it started to rain a bit harder, and it even looked like a few snowflakes by the time it hit the ground, so we cooled off very quickly while we were getting ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the glacier,  we found some cool blue ice holes and practiced walking with our crampons.  Then Gabe asked if we would like to try some ice climbing.  Why not?!  The vacation has been injury free so far so we might as well try something new.  This was really a blast even though it was just a short little climb to get the hang of it.  Ice climbing involves driving your crampons straight into the ice wall, while hanging from two pick axes.  Of course we had a safety line so we wouldn't fall, if we lost our grip.  It was really fun but took a lot of effort.  Brian and I made it all the way to the top, and Jane and Holly both made a good run at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5771834273889991554'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qmmjylvR6Mc/UBmssQ2jO4I/AAAAAAAAAs8/xORntUnISYc/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point we had been hiking and on the glacier for about three and a half hours.  We knew we had two and a half more to get back so we were just about at the point to say it was time to head back, but Gabe had one last surprise for us.  He took us over to the side of the glacier where we took off our crampons and hiked down to a spot where there was a cave.  We hiked right inside the glacier.  There was a little stream flowing into the glacier, and the ice was really amazing.  Overhead the ice was glowing blue from the light filtering in from above.  On the sides it looked like polished metal, which was because the ice was dirty and there was no light coming in from that direction.  The idea of being inside this glacier, with the blue glow all around us made the whole day worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5771834333199631826'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s3o-OTNDYHs/UBmsvtzEhdI/AAAAAAAAAtE/cnucsBYwKhc/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When our spelunking was finished it was time to pack up our gear into the backpacks again and head back.  By this time our feet were dead tired and the rain was coming down very steadily.  Up until now the day had been all type 1 fun, but a two-and-a-half hour death march back to the car in the rain turned it into type 2.  One fun little bonus on the trip back was that we saw some salmon swimming up one of the small streams.  After catching them and seeing them jumping in the ocean it was interesting to see them heading up stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got back to the ship, and headed to the hot tub.  That did wonders for our legs, but we were so tired we didn't even bother to dress for dinner in the dining room, we just threw on some clothes and went to the buffet.  I believe this may be a first for us in skipping dinner in the dining room in favor of the buffet!  Holly was sound asleep well before 10:00, I went to the magic show, and along with Jane made it to 10:30.  Gone are the days of partying on the ship until midnight or after I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>ketchikan</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/ketchikan.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-07-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-07-29:/PelicanBlog/ketchikan.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its a lazy, rainy afternoon here in Ketchikan Alaska.

We are back from fishing and have warmed up with some lunch and a nice soak in the hot tub. The ship should be pulling out of port any minute now and we'll be on our way to Icy Strait. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last 24 hours have been a lot of fun.  In terms of a sea day, yesterday would have to rank way up there for the unique experience it provided us.  As you know from my previous blog post I can't say much about it.  We were  part of a very familiar kind of scene to those of you who actually watch this particular kind of show.  Meaning we were a part of a large group that got to try out some wonderful food and then share our thoughts.  Whether or not we'll ever be seen by millions of people is all in the hands of some editor at this point.  But I know I'll look forward to this episode.  It will always remind me that Holly does not know what Jamie Oliver actually looks like, since he wasn't here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night we had our second phenomenal  dinner in Qsine.  This is the restaurant that features the iPads,  we were rewArDed by seeing someone faMous at the tAble next to us.  We didn't intrude on her privacy since she was having dinner with her family and celebrating her father's birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning we were up bright and early for our fishing expedition.  It was just the four of us and captain Bob.  Bob was a great captain, he's a salty dog that has been guiding fishing trips here in Ketchikan since the 1970s.  We had a lot of fun fishing for salmon, even though it was a bit on the cold and rainy side.  The high for the day was about 57 degrees, and we had rain off and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course we had to turn even a small fishing expedition into some kind of a competition.  Although as competitions go this was pretty tame since we took turns reeling in the fish.  At the end of the morning we had 14 fish in the hold.  All of them nice pink salmon, that we'll look forward to receiving via Fed Ex when we get back home.  Here's Holly and Captain Bob netting one of our first salmon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5770741454266452450'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1YZ1htmp_04/UBXKxygsSeI/AAAAAAAAAsc/4Em1Te1WH-o/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here's Jane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5770741568587309026'&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nql3VBxgmPU/UBXK4cY6H-I/AAAAAAAAAsk/qCDSrDZiKGM/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we are looking forward to eating in the main dining room, and relaxing at one of the shows on the ship.  It looks like the main entertainment is a comedian and that is often fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we are looking forward to a day of whale watching, biking, and zip-lining!

I'm looking out the back of the ship at a lot of very low hanging clouds.  We are in a "family view" stateroom, which means that we have one of the largest decks of anybody onboard.  It is perfect for this Alaskan cruise as we can see both directions and even have a great forward view.  When the ship is moving we can sit out on the covered part of the deck where we are sheltered from the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was a really fun day.  We woke up in our two room suite at the Executive Hotel in Vancouver.  Jane and I walked the two blocks down to Tim Horton's to get coffee, bagels and donuts.  The plan for the day was to shop for wine, water, and soda to bring on board.  With shopping complete the next activity is to rent bikes and ride around Stanley park.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we headed out for our shopping Holly realized that she was missing her tongue scraper!??  What the heck is a tongue scraper?  Brian and I were full of extremely unhelpful suggestions for what might substitute as a tongue scraper.  My suggestions of Emery boards or repurposed floss were particularly unhelpful since I had no idea what one should even look like.  When Holly did finally describe one to me, it seemed perfectly reasonable that a spare plastic zip tie would work.  Many pharmacies later we found one, and all was well with the dental hygiene world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say the neighborhood we were shopping in was a bit sketchy.  We passed by several very interesting sex shops, one featuring mannequins dressed in thongs fighting with light sabers.  We tried to convince Holly that we had seen tongue scrapers inside the adult book store, but she didn't go for it. The liquor store we were going to opened at 9:30 and it was quite an interesting study in humanity.  People were literally waiting outside the door for the store to open.  When the iron gate of the front door was finally unlocked there was a rush inside for people to buy their first drink of the day.  Needless to say we were left alone in the fine wine section of the store.  We found a nice selection of British Columbia wines to try including some very interestingly named varietals.  Hatfield's Fuse, Quails Gate, and Sandhill.  As we checked out with our bottles to take aboard, the guy ahead of us in line was literally shaking to pay for his two beers and get out the door so he could pop one open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of the shopping behind us, we returned to the hotel, where we were granted a late checkout time of 12:30.  This worked perfectly for our bike ride.  The bike rental place was just around the corner.  Vancouver is an extremely bike friendly place.  There were great bike lanes that took us from the bike rental place to the pier area and then around the park.  It was really beautiful.  Although it wasn't a workout pace it was a fun ride, and a good way to get to know the city a little better.  We will definitely come back someday just to spend some time in and around the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the bike ride complete we ordered a taxi and headed to the pier.  As we were going through the customs line we were joking with one man who was sent to the much shorter line for 'the film crew.'  Yes, much mystery surrounds this first night on the ship.  Our reservation in Qsine had to be changed at the last minute because of a filming for a 'food related show.'&lt;br /&gt;We of course pumped this guy for information, but he couldn't tell us anything.  I even tried the old, 'blink once if its Alton' line but he just laughed and headed through customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in Qsine we had a really great time with the wait staff and the maitre de.  We said, OK, look we know something is happening because they changed our reservation, so who is it?  Whats going on?  Finally, a member of the staff, who identified himself as James Bond, agreed to the you guess and I'll nod game.  I got the person and the show right on my second guess.  For which we were rewarded with an invitation to dinner at Qsine again tonight where we may be part of the taping.  We will have to sign non-disclosure agreements, so although I would love to reveal the name of the show, I can't.  I will say that this could be at the &lt;i&gt;Top&lt;/i&gt; of my list for exciting happenings aboard the ship.  If I get to meet a celebrity &lt;i&gt;Chef&lt;/i&gt; that would certainly be a highlight of my amateur culinary life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Inside%20Passage,%20enroute%20to%20Alaska&amp;z=10'&gt;Inside Passage, enroute to Alaska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>exhaustion</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/exhaustion.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-07-06:/PelicanBlog/exhaustion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its official folks, I'm ready to head home.  The ITiCSE conference is over.  The paper has been presented, I've been to a dozen or more sessions.  I'm tired.  I'd like to get something to eat, but all the restaurants in the area are not even open for dinner yet, and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its official folks, I'm ready to head home.  The ITiCSE conference is over.  The paper has been presented, I've been to a dozen or more sessions.  I'm tired.  I'd like to get something to eat, but all the restaurants in the area are not even open for dinner yet, and its 7pm!  This is a good conference.  I appreciate that many of the sessions seem a bit more technical than would be typical at SIGCSE and I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was here alone at the conference I've met some really nice people, and made some good connections with others doing research in areas that overlap with &lt;a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org"&gt;Runestone Interactive&lt;/a&gt; in one way or another.  I've got a lot of ideas about what may be good directions to go next with the project, and lots of ideas on some new literature that I should be studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whats left of this trip?  Tomorrow I'm taking a tour of Cesarea that will start at 7:30 tomorrow morning and will end with me getting dropped off at the airport at 2pm.  The buzz at the conference this afternoon was about getting out of Isreal.  Apparently, security is much tougher going out of the country than it is going in.  So it is recommended to be at the airport 3 hours ahead of your flight.  I'll fly to Heathrow and I've got a room at the Sofitel.  That just seems to make the most sense.  I don't have to find and pay for a bus to drop me off at another hotel, as I can just walk.  It has free WiFi, and it will be easy for me to walk back over and go through security in the morning to rejoin the group.  I really miss being with the group.   Saturday we fly from London to Chicago and then we still have five hours of driving to get us home.  Its actually hard to imagine that I will be home in roughly 48 + 8 hours.  The +8 is the hours that are lost to timezone changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting outside my hotel writing this I had the good fortune to be invited to dinner by one of my new colleagues that I met at ITiCSE.  David was traveling with his family and it was very nice to have a relaxing dinner again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="israel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>high security</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/high-security.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-07-06:/PelicanBlog/high-security.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm through security.  Sitting in  Segafredo Zanetti, enjoying a very nice Israeli Chardonnay.  Everyone told me to get to Ben Gurion at least 3 hours before my flight so that I could get through the security process.  Now I understand why.  These people are serious about their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm through security.  Sitting in  Segafredo Zanetti, enjoying a very nice Israeli Chardonnay.  Everyone told me to get to Ben Gurion at least 3 hours before my flight so that I could get through the security process.  Now I understand why.  These people are serious about their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first get to the airport you have to get in a line to get your luggage X-rayed before you even get to check in for your flight and get your boarding pass.  This is the initial grilling.  Passport please? Long study of the passport followed by a long study of my face.   Why were you in israel, where did you stay, do you have a receipt?  Did anyone give you a present?   Where has your luggage been?  Is it remotely possible that someone could have gotten access to your luggage? You were at a conference?  Can you prove it? and on and on…  Finally when he seemed satisfied, there was much flipping through my passport and studying of dates and places.  Are these guys working for Mosad or are they low level airport security employees??  My bet is on the former.  Dude, I'm trying to leave your country not smuggle something in.  Once you get past this initial questioning, your luggage is put through some kind of industrial strength X-ray machine.  When the X-ray is done your bag is pretty much ejected as if being shot out of a cannon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British airways desk is pretty easy compared to the initial grilling.  And because it takes so long to answer all of the questions and get your bags X-rayed, the lines at the checkin counter are pretty short.  Sadly I did not get a free upgrade from Israel to London.  But, I did get an aisle seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have to go through security.  Passport and boarding pass.  Everything out.  OK, my Namibian Rock sculpture seems to be a real curiosity.  Thank God I didn't bring the Magnetite!  I think the rock sculpture went back and forth through the X-ray machine 3 times in three different orientations.  Finally, all was well and I was able to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought you were done… passport control.  Again with the questions, and studying of the passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally you are through.  Now, here's the final indignity.  My guide for the morning had told me that the Golan Heights Chardonnay was well worth getting in the duty free shop.  Sounds great.  So, I head to the "worlds largest duty free" and ask the guy where the Golan Heights Chardonnay is.  Right here sir.  But…. "Are you flying to the US?"   Yes I am.  Well, sir, you are not allowed to take any liquids into the USA if you are coming from Israel.  Really??  But, its duty free, I thought that was allowed.  "I'm sorry sir, they do not trust our security"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  Yes, there was one more passport check as I passed out of the common area and onto my concourse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="israel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>saying goodbye to namibia</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/saying-goodbye-to-namibia.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-07-06:/PelicanBlog/saying-goodbye-to-namibia.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the lobby of the Hotel Safari this morning.  We've checked out and are just hanging here until about 11:00 before we head to the airport.  It seems like a lifetime ago that we checked in here, exhausted, and grubby after 39 hours of travel from the USA …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the lobby of the Hotel Safari this morning.  We've checked out and are just hanging here until about 11:00 before we head to the airport.  It seems like a lifetime ago that we checked in here, exhausted, and grubby after 39 hours of travel from the USA.  Now we are refreshed, our bodies are on the right time zone and heading on to the next segment of our journey.  Its really strange to think that I'm heading to Israel, while the rest of the group is heading to cape town.  One consolation is that I'll be enjoying nice warm 90 degree weather, while they will be in Cape Town's winter at 59 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we had a very nice dinner at Nampa and Matty's house.  I'm very jealous of Matty's indoor wood fired oven.  He had obviously been grilling meat for us all afternoon.  Not only does it make delicious meat but it also heats their family room.  It was amazing to hear the story of these two Luther College Alums.  They were at Luther in the mid 90's, but by the time they found their way to college in the USA they were married and had small children.  They are so grateful to the people of Decorah for their hospitality and help that they are always eager to open their home to Americans who are traveling in Namibia.  We worked hard on their youngest daughter to convince her that she must come to Luther to go to college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I think about the two purposes of our trip, the philanthropic, and the cultural I am inspired to try to return someday, and to help to keep up the good work that &lt;a href="http://empoweringlearnersnamibia.blogspot.com"&gt;EmpoweringLearnersNamibia&lt;/a&gt; has started.  There is so much more we can do to help, and it really doesn't take much money to accomplish a lot here.  For example a new Kindergarden school could be built to replace the 10x12 metal shack for about  $5000.00 US.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>almost back to windhoek</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/almost-back-to-windhoek.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-07-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-07-02:/PelicanBlog/almost-back-to-windhoek.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are on the B2 not 55km from Windhoek and the Safari Hotel.  Suddenly our coach makes a very bad noise and we begin to coast down the road.  Joey looks rather concerned.  We coast to a stop and pull over to the side of the road.  One …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are on the B2 not 55km from Windhoek and the Safari Hotel.  Suddenly our coach makes a very bad noise and we begin to coast down the road.  Joey looks rather concerned.  We coast to a stop and pull over to the side of the road.  One of the few places in all of Namibia where there is almost no shoulder.  The diagnosis is dire, the clutch plate is out.  Luckily its only 1:15 in the afternoon and we are close to our destination.  David is on the phone getting another coach on its way.  This bus that we've spent so many hours with is not taking us any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we are all in good spirits.  The sun is out, the weather is nice.  We are joking about our plight and assessing our provisions.  In the cooler we have some apples, a half bottle of Riesling and one Windhoek light.  Suddenly Joey says… "I need a beer!"  We all crack up, we'd be happy to give Joey our last beer, he's been such a good sport with great humor this entire trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thankful that this little mishap happened here.  When we think of all the places this could have happened. The middle of Etosha, the middle of the desert, Each of which would be hours and hours from anywhere likely to have the ability to come and get us.  We'll be just fine, and this answers the important question of what to write about in today's blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  We're moving again, in a lovely, highly air conditioned coach.  Its just 2:55 so we were only delayed about 1:45.  When the replacement bus got here we formed a bucket brigade and transferred the luggage from one to the other in no time.  We're looking forward to arriving at the Safari and we'll still have some time to relax and refresh before we go to our dinner at Nampa and Matty's house.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>a day in the dunes</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-day-in-the-dunes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-30:/PelicanBlog/a-day-in-the-dunes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It really does remind you of a scene out of Dune, and at times its like you are on another world.  The sand is so fine, but yet its not dusty, its clean.  This is the Namib Desert, the oldest desert in the world and home to the worlds largest …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It really does remind you of a scene out of Dune, and at times its like you are on another world.  The sand is so fine, but yet its not dusty, its clean.  This is the Namib Desert, the oldest desert in the world and home to the worlds largest sand dunes.  The tallest of the dunes is over 1000 feet tall, you have to keep reminding yourself that its all sand!  These aren't hills with a little sand on the top, this is a moveable work of sand art that is hundreds of feet high and changes all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Living Desert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off our day we went on a Living Desert tour with Tommy, the owner of the company.  He had a giant WWII vintage Land Rover (He collects land rovers -- and large belt buckles )  He's fifty something always wears shorts, runs like a bow legged cowboy and has more one liners than anyone I have ever met.  He had us all in tears by the end of the tour.  "All the desert creatures are just like a beautiful woman, you treat them gently and with respect and everything will be fine" he says with a grin.  "When I met my wife, I said I am the head of the household, she said fine, I am the neck you will look where I point you."   He was also extremely knowledgeable about the whole desert ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think what desert ecosystem?  What lives in a bunch of giant piles of sand where they only get 15millimeters of rain a year?  It turns out quite a lot, but you pretty much have to dig up everything out here that is alive.  For the first 45 minutes of the trip it was pretty quiet because it was overcast and quite cool, Tommy kept jumping out of the land rover muttering, I just have to check on something.  He would trot away up the dune, stop at a seemingly random spot and then scoop his arm down deep in the sand.  Or he would run up to one of the dollar bushes and poke around with his sand wedge for a few minutes only to return to the vehicle saying "nothing!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of these little forays paid off, he put his hand behind his back and with a huge grin on his face beckoned for us to get out and join him.  Our first specimen was a lizard of some sort that he talked about how it survived by burrowing in the sand, water comes from the fog that rolls in off the Atlantic, just a few drops are all that is required, it turns out it also makes its own water by a chemical reaction with the food it eats.  Pretty cool.  Then, the showman asks Mary to kneel before him ("I like it when women kneel in front of me" he says) Then he takes the lizard and lets it clamp onto her earlobe with its tiny little jaws.  "New Earrings!!"  Oh, my, all the women in the group are subjected to this little bit, and we get some great photos.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask him, how he knows where to dig, he says "I read the bushman daily newspaper"  You see the very top layers of the sand are a combination of sand and magnetite which makes very interesting wave like patterns.  Once you learn the signs to look for they are pretty obvious.  He's been scanning for sidewinder tracks since the beginning, and although we've seen some tracks, no snakes yet.  So, he stops the rover next to a particularly magnetite rich area, and hops out with his hand and something else inside a plastic grocery bag.  We follow him a little ways up the dune and he drops down to his knees and proclaims, "now I will show you how we iron the desert."  Of course he's got a magnet inside the bag and its picking up tons of the tiny magnetite particles.  After showing us some artwork, and dumping a bunch of magnetite on Mary's arm to show us how he can make the hair stand up on end, he asks if anyone would like it?  Sure!  I'm thinking this would make a great plaything for my office.  Now I'm wondering how in the world I'm going to get a tennis ball sized blob of magnetite through airport security!!??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we find our sidewinder, also buried in the sand, along with a horned viper, a gecko, and tow very interesting chameleons.  All in all it was really interesting to see all this life where its pretty easy to assume that none exists.  We continue our journey with Tommy finishing up the full morning with a joy ride through the sand dunes in his giant four by four.  The scenery in the dunes is spectacular.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing marring this perfect desert landscape is the tents from the Mad Max IV film crew that is running around and apparently doing lots of things they should not be doing in the desert, one of them being messing with Tommy's schedule --  "The idiot, in a match between a Range Rover and a human, who does he think is going to win?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ATV Ride!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving the Dunes Tommy dropped us off for the next part of our adventurous day.  A Desert eXplorers ATV and sand boarding trip. After the requisite signing of the legal waivers we are quickly outfitted with hairnets and helmets.  "Do I really need one?" I ask rubbing my very short hair.  Josh's answer is short and practical, "Keeps out the lice Dad"  Hmmm.  Then we are given a choice between the automatic or manual clutch ATVs.  We all wisely choose the automatics.  After a few quick instructions about hand signals we are off!  Driving through the dunes is amazing, the hardest part is that you really do have to pay attention and follow the leader or else there are lots of places where you could get stuck or end up upside down.  As we go along we get more and more adventurous, taking the ATVs way up steep banks and straight down even steeper run outs.  Its exhilarating and tons of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so of this we stop at a particularly tall and steep dune.  This is our sand boarding stop.  Sandboarding is done on a piece of particle board that our guide waxes up for us. you lay down on it, pull up the front and away you go, down the dune.  Its a lot like going sledding in the winter only a lot drier.  Also a lot like sledding is that its not really much fun to trudge back up the dune, your shoes filling with sand and sinking up to your ankles in the sand.  Its a lot of work!  But we had a lot of fun, and I got my first chance to use our new head cam, to capture my runs down the dune.  Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have about an hour of ATV riding through the dunes left, but its getting to be 4:30 so the sun is getting a bit low in the sky and there are lots more shadows now, this makes it all a bit more tricky.  We are almost to the very end when our guide suddenly motions us to stop and whips his ATV around and goes racing back.  We all crane our necks to see whats going on.  Its Ann, she's tipped her ATV over in that last little bumpy patch.  Not only is our guide racing toward her but three other guides in blaze orange that were leading other groups have seen the accident and rush to her aid.  After a few anxious moments we can see that she's up and walking, her trusty hand bag still still at her side.  Jerry says it was a spectacular fall.  Ann says all of her orifices are still full of sand.  We're all just thankful that she walked away with nothing more than a twisted knee.  Its a bit swollen and sore but she's still getting around.  This is definitely a day we will all remember for a long time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally get back to the guest house at about 5:15 tired, and very hungry, other than a few little candy bars and some trail mix we haven't eaten anything during the day.  The rest of the group bought happy hour supplies and made a 7:00 dinner reservation, so we drink some champagne to toast Gregory and Ann's anniversary.  We laugh about the fact that we had two anniversaries on this trip, but both occurred during our stays in decidedly unromantic accommodations!  Finally we head out for dinner to the Tug, a seafood restaurant right on the Jetty.  We enjoy some good food in a nice warm dry atmosphere before walking back and going to sleep in our somewhat less warm and less dry rooms at the guest house.  We remark once again that we've said the same thing about so many of our days here in Namibia, "What a day!  I'm going to remember this for a long time"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing today to let you know that I won't be in church for a while, probably about a year.  Believe me when I say that it is not your fault or the fault of anyone at First Lutheran.  Its just that I attended an ordination service for the Evangelical Lutheran Church In Namibia (ELCIN) here in Namibia, at the brand new church in the  Onesi parish.  This church just opened in April of this year so it was a great honor for them to host the ordination.  It is a large, but simple church built of bricks with a metal corrugated roof.  Its laid out in a traditional cross shape.    I have a number of points to share with you but I'll get right to the main reason for my absence…  The service lasted from 9AM until 4PM, yes SEVEN hours of church without a single break.  In my humble opinion I've now earned more than a few weeks off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulletin we got when we arrived had a schedule on it.  The Ordination service started at 9:00AM right on time, it was to be done by 10:30 when the newly ordained would lead a full worship service.  At 12:00 we were to receive the greetings.  In reality, the worship service started at 12:30 and the greetings section started about 2:30.  Things last as long as they last here in Africa.  As you can guess, nobody would have any problem with the service going a little over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the seven hours I was sitting on a plastic chair I had some time to reflect on what we might learn from the Namibians, and I'd like to take this opportunity to share them with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start with Hospitality.  You need to know that the church was overflowing with people from all over the country, and indeed the world.  The bishop from  neighboring Angola and representatives from the government, local tribal leaders, and the governor of this part of the country.  There appears to be very strong cooperation between the church and state in this country.  There were probably 2,000 people in attendance, and many of them had to be seated outside.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived on our bus about 10 minutes before the service started, after driving three hours, including the last 28 kilometers on dirt roads.  We  were far from the the last ones there as we passed an amazing number of people walking to the service.  Many of them walked many miles, others were packed into the back of pickup trucks like sardines.  However, when we arrived we were ushered right over to an empty pew, reserved just for our group.  Unfortunately we did not all fit in our allotted pew, so Ethan and I were shown to the back row of the section reserved for pastors.  When the pastors processed in it was very clear that they needed our spots desperately, so we tried to move, but they wouldn't have anything to do with that!  Eventually plastic chairs were brought in and we were moved so that we could sit closer to our group.  Now here's an example of the kind of hospitality we should all aspire to, within a few minutes all of us were shuffled yet again, but this time we had pastors in our midst that served as translators for us for the entire service!  Some had their own personal translator while others were in pairs.  These pastors graciously shared their Oshiovambo hymnals with us, so that we could do our best to sing along on the SEVEN hymns on the hymn board.  And those seven were just a start, there were many many more that were sung as impromptu additions to the service. Amazingly, almost all of the hymn tunes were very familiar, so we could just about sing along in english using the words we remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note about the ELCIN and their need for pastors.  There is a great need for pastors here in Namibia, we were told that the ELCIN needs 40 pastors, which means that many congregations must make do with lay leadership only.  Today there were 5 candidates for ordination, but lest you think that each year they ordain five new pastors, we learned that they only do an ordination service every four years.  So for the candidates and the parishes this was a huge celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were treated as honored and distinguished guests the entire day.  During the greetings section of the service (which lasted an hour and a half)  our group was invited to come to the front and share a song.  So, we sang our Yalo song -- in  Oshiovambo --  and we were rock stars!  Of course we were already something of an oddity since other than three Finnish missionaries, we were the only white people in attendance.  After the service we were invited to dine with the presiding bishop to celebrate the occasion.  We were definitely in Lutheran hands as the dinner accommodations included carrot raisin salad, macaroni, and potato salad.   In a true namibian twist the meat section of the buffet featured grilled intestines along with several other options more appealing to the midwestern pallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me turn to the Youth program.  While Adrian does an exceptional job, someone here in Namibia has really got this figured out.  In the crowd of people at this service were kids of all ages, and they stayed the entire time!  Many of the young kids sat on the floor near the front the entire service.  In addition, since the church was overflowing we saw 20-30 teen aged youth who stood outside the church putting their heads in the windows.  Yep, they stood in the windows for the entire service.  What an amazing thing.  Many of the parishes brought their youth choirs who were allowed to sing one and only one song during the collection of the offering.  They were awesome.  After the service there was a sort of impromptu battle of the choirs as they stood outside trying to out-sing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is what we might learn about stewardship from these great people.  Before the offering was taken an announcement was made.  First of all they were a bit short the previous week, so all were admonished to give generously.  She made the point that paper donations were definitely preferred over coins.  When the offering started, the choirs kicked in.  But now everyone was ushered to the front where a large basket was placed on a  chair, people came forward and placed their donations in the basket one by one.  Ethan told us that in other services he'd attended the offering might be taken up to three times, so you should plan ahead and divide your offering in thirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of staffing I might say that having a master of ceremonies is an interesting idea.  A very distinguished older lady, Meme, in the native language, was in charge of first, letting everyone know how the service would unfold, and what to do when.  Again this is a nice way to help visitors feel at home and know whats coming up.  She did tend to ramble on and on a bit, as even our translators rolled their eyes after a while.  But her heart was clearly in the right place.  So the lesson here is that if we go this direction, we should choose this position with care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I need to apologize to you.  In the ELCIN pastors are not called, they are sent, and in some cases the pastor is the first the congregation has ever had.  Nevertheless, I don't feel that you received  a proper welcome at First Lutheran.  After the pastors were ordained the secretary general formally announced where they were sent.  When the parish name was called the people of the parish stood and cheered, and clapped.   The women Ulilated and waved zebra tails in the air.  If that doesn't make a guy feel welcome I don't know what would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, its about time to pack up the bus and head into Etosha national park.  You know I was just kidding about skipping for a year right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care, and see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was another amazing day.  We got up fairly early to observe a few animals at the Moringa water hole at the Halali Rest Camp, but it was a pretty quiet morning.  A few zebras, some Kudu, and a bunch of Guinea Hens.  We had some breakfast, and then set out for the day.  We had to be out of the park by 5:30PM (sundown) and we had a lot of animal viewing in store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two real highlights of the day.  First, we witnessed a herd of 42 yes 42 elephants!  This herd included elephants of all ages, including babies up to the old bull that was clearly in charge of it all.  We saw to older males challenging each other for something, and younger males emulating them.  Its interesting to see them face off, then wrap their trunks together and then go head to head pushing on each other.  Just think of the strength behind all that pushing.  We even heard the old male trumpet to get everyone's attention and get the herd moving again.  At one point they must have smelled a lion or a leopard because everyone started running.  This didn't last very long and soon they were back to drinking at the water hole.  This must have been a unique gathering because even the Namibian's who were working on building a solar water pump were taking a break to watch all of this action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw this same behavior with a  huge herd of Springbok and a dazzle of Zebra earlier in the day.  They were just standing around doing whatever springbok and Zebras do, when all of the sudden they all took off, David said this is because they smell a leopard.  After running a ways they stopped and stood very still, all of them just staring in one direction.  We tried to see what they were looking at but couldn't see anything but grass and bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second highlight of the day came at the end of the day when we saw Lions again.  Its amazing we saw them at all, they blend into the grass so well.  On one side of the road were four mature lions just sunning themselves, literally lying on their backs legs spread apart, soaking up the sun. Finally one of them got up and moved to a new spot so we were able to get a really good look.  On the other side of the road was a Lioness and her cubs, at first all we spotted were the ears sticking up next to one of the bushes, but with patience we were finally rewarded with some nice views of all the cubs and the mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what we saw today was the same animals that we have been seeing since entering the park, and after a while you just get numb to the whole thing until you remind yourself what a rare opportunity it is to see these animals in their natural habitat.  Animal Kingdom this is not.  One of the new animals we did see today was the heartbeats, another antelope that is the second fastest.  It gets its name from its horns which look like a heart when you see them from the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its really crazy that we have just two days in Swakopmund and then on Sunday we head back to Windhoek in preparation for leaving Namibia on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>photo highlights from namibia</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/photo-highlights-from-namibia.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-30:/PelicanBlog/photo-highlights-from-namibia.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, its really hard to pick out the photo highlights from this trip, but I decided to take a quick stab at it during my hour at the internet cafe today.  So, here's a link to the flickr photoset.  Hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>the living desert tour</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-first-adventure-of-the-day-was-the-living-desert-tour-with-tommy-tommy-is-a-.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-30:/PelicanBlog/the-first-adventure-of-the-day-was-the-living-desert-tour-with-tommy-tommy-is-a-.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6fb7qTldF1r729pmo1_1280.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we also found an Chameleon, a sidewinder, a horned adder, and lots of different beetles.  You just can't believe the beauty of the sand dunes.  These are the largest in the world with some of them over 1000 feet tall.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>lions and rhinos and springbok, oh my! etosha!</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/lions-and-rhinos-and-springbok-oh-my-etosha.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-28:/PelicanBlog/lions-and-rhinos-and-springbok-oh-my-etosha.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If someone had told me six months ago that in the span of 24 hours I would see nine Lions,  two Rhino, four Elephants, three Hyena, one Jackal, a Journey of Giraffe, a Dazzle of Zebra, and countless Wildebeest, Springbok, Oryx, and Impala I would never have thought it possible …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If someone had told me six months ago that in the span of 24 hours I would see nine Lions,  two Rhino, four Elephants, three Hyena, one Jackal, a Journey of Giraffe, a Dazzle of Zebra, and countless Wildebeest, Springbok, Oryx, and Impala I would never have thought it possible.  But that is exactly what happened this last day.  As Ann remarked, "whoever thought I would be so casual about seeing another Zebra"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the drive into the park we got really excited about seeing  a couple of Elephants and Giraffe in the distance, then Joey pulled off onto one of the many side roads that takes you to a water hole and we were able to get a little closer.  But later we were to find out that that initial excitement was just an appetizer.  A couple of water holes down the road, we pulled up and there were two huge elephants just standing 20 yards from the bus.  And the Giraffe seemed to be everywhere along the side of the road.  It was really incredible to get so close to all of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for a late lunch and then walked to the water hole at the Na… Rest Camp, someone had sited another elephant and it looked like we could get close to this one standing on the observation platform.  However when I got out there it had disappeared into the bush.  I had turned around and was headed back toward the bus when Josh Martin softly called me back -- "Rihno!"  I got back but the Rhino had wandered into the trees so I was only able to get a partial shot of it with my camera.  I have a great 70-200mm zoom, but I was now wishing I had upgraded to the new 100-300 model!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to our rest camp we were all planning to sign up for an open air Jeep excursion.  It was a little confusing, but our options were to go out at 5:30AM, midday, or an evening excursion starting at 18:30.  I don't think any of us was particularly excited about getting up for another early morning drive, so lots of conversation ensued.  In the end we all booked the 5:30AM tour and were not disappointed.  Remember that we are in Africa, so even though the days are long in the Northern Hemisphere we are at some of the shortest days here.  At 5:30 it was still completely dark.  However we were treated to a spectacular view of Venus and Mars.  Our guide and driver for the morning was named Samuel, he's been working in the park for 20 years and does an amazing job of spotting the game.  We told him that we really wanted to see some cats and he smiled and told us that what you see on any given day is mostly luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove for quite a while in the dark with Samuel illuminating our path with a red handheld light.  It was COLD, we all had on many layers including winter coats, and luckily Samuel provided us with ponchos to put over our legs for another layer of warmth.  We never really did see anything in the dark.  At the first water hole we stopped we didn't see anything so we drove around to the other side of the water hole where Samuel said 'Lion!'  We looked and at first none of us could see it, but eventually we all saw what he was pointing to.  A male lion laying down at the edge of the water hole munching on something that was freshly killed.  As I was watching the lion through my long lens I noticed something much darker pop up from the grass behind the lion.  Samuel confirmed that it was a Hyena, in fact there are probably several of them waiting for their chance to eat whatever the lion leaves behind.  We also discovered that there was another lion that had been lying a few meters away from the first.  We were just starting to pull away when we were rewarded with a final view of the Lion who stood up and took a big stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove on through herds of Zebra and all kinds of antelope when Samuel spotted another pair of Lions just on the edge of the pan, these were farther away than the first but the light was much better so I was able to get some good pictures and really zoom in on these.  In fact it turned out that there were seven Lion in this area, and Samuel said probably two more that we didn't see, because the pride is eleven, and we had already seen two of them at the previous water hole.  The drama of seeing this group of Lions was heightened by one lonesome and apparently suicidal Springbok.  This poor creature seemed completely unaware of the Lions and just kept wandering closer and closer.  Samuel said that Lions only strike if they know they won't have to chase their prey for more than 100 meters, but would could see the lions get very still and very low to the ground, they clearly had not missed this Springbok.  Eventually the little guy came to his senses and escaped with his life, at least for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got back from the drive we went to breakfast and we have spent the rest of the day sitting and observing at the water hole, or lying around the pool area soaking up some of the warm midday and afternoon sun.  We are hoping for a return of the Rhinos that appeared here last night, but as Samuel said its mostly luck as to what might show up on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as I finished writing those words we were rewarded.  A giraffe came ever so slowly and cautiously out of the trees to get a drink.  This is a really amazing process.  First she approaches the water hole very slowly, checking each way several times.  Then she must get in position to drink, which involves spreading her legs very wide  so her neck can reach the water, but you can tell this puts the giraffe in a very vulnerable position so much stopping and starting and looking around ensues as she prepares to drink.  And when she does its a long one.  Twenty seconds maybe with the mouth in the water, and then with a mighty shake she raises her body up and assumes a position that looks like she's ready to flee.  With all of us sitting up here taking pictures and whispering she is very cautious of us.  What a site, this whole trip to the water hole probably took just over an hour between her cautious approach to the hole and then multiple long approaches and drinks.  Patience is a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>top chef challenge in etosha</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/top-chef-challenge-in-etosha.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-28:/PelicanBlog/top-chef-challenge-in-etosha.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a long day of driving and viewing the animals we pulled into our accommodations at Halial Rest Camp in Etosha National Park.  Although it was a long dusty day of driving we saw many game animals (see my related post) on the drive so it was well worth it …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a long day of driving and viewing the animals we pulled into our accommodations at Halial Rest Camp in Etosha National Park.  Although it was a long dusty day of driving we saw many game animals (see my related post) on the drive so it was well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had made the decision in the morning to have a Braai for supper tonight, so we bought steaks and pasta and some supplies for making sauce at the Pic-N-Pay in Oshikati.  Based on the descriptions of our Bush Chalets we knew that we had an outdoor grilling area (the Braai) along with cooking supplies and utensils in the room.  The Bush Chalets are just fantastic, ours was two bedroom, with a living area and separate toilet and shower areas.   All of which looked quite new.  The only problem was that the cooking supplies were missing!  We all had some plates and bowls and silverware, but no pots or pans suitable for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COOL!!  This is like a Quick Fire challenge on Top Chef.  We got some firewood and kindling from the gift shop and talked Joey out of his lighter for five minutes to get the fire going.  We slit open the steaks and added some namibian barbecue dry rub to them along with a little salt and pepper, let them site for a while and the steaks are taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you cook pasta and pasta sauce with no pots and pans.  Well, we all had hot pots in our room for boiling water to make coffee or tea.  If you can boil water you can cook noodles.  To make the sauce we just opened the cans (thank God for swiss army knives) and set them next to the fire.  Add a helping of noodles to the bowl, spoon out some tomatoes and some pureed tomatoes and a few mushrooms from their respective cans and viola you have a nice sauce for your noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add in some raw veggies, and some grilled red and yellow peppers and you have a regular feast.  Of course a couple of glasses of wine at happy hour probably helped make it all taste better than it was but it will definitely go down as one of the more memorable meals of the trip.  After supper we continued to sit around the fire and talk and share great memories with each other.  It was a great night, thanks friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category><category term="cooking"></category></entry><entry><title>computer science class</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/here-s-a-picture-of-my-new-friends-in-the-computer-science-class-at-oshigambo-hi.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-23:/PelicanBlog/here-s-a-picture-of-my-new-friends-in-the-computer-science-class-at-oshigambo-hi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m62bfzWylt1r729pmo1_1280.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of my new friends in the computer science class at Oshigambo High School.  Their teacher, Alice, is an amazing person.  As you can see they are not working with the most modern of computers, but they are doing some really good projects.  The students are learning both Visual Basic, and Turbo Pascal.  They were all eager to show me their projects, which are year long projects.  I saw everything from payroll systems to equipment ordering systems.  These students must first design the entire user interface, and then develop a system flowchart along with a set of written requirements.  Once all of that is done they start building their system using visual basic and access.  I wish more American schools would get this far in their computer science curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were getting a short tour of the high school when we walked into the computer lab.  Their teacher said that I was a computer science teacher from the USA.  They immediately pulled me in and I was surrounded by the students.  When I told them I was from Luther College it was as if I were some kind of rock star.  Thanks to Tim Peter and Greg Peterson for brining groups of students to this high school before.  They all well remembered the singing group that was here from Luther 2 years ago.  I signed up a dozen students to get additional admissions information.  I'm going to ask Scot for a bonus for my recruiting efforts today.  I wish that I would have had more time, to spend with the class.  Many of them had questions and were testing the limits of my pathetic Visual Basic skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to give them a demonstration of the Python eBook I've been working on, so maybe that will become a resource that they can use in the future.  I know that after seeing their computer lab everyone was  pleased that we were able to bring them 24 laptops and 50 graphing calculators.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>rev. p. hanock kindergarden.</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/our-second-stop-of-the-day-yesterday-was-at-the-rev-p-hanock-kindergarden-this-s.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-23:/PelicanBlog/our-second-stop-of-the-day-yesterday-was-at-the-rev-p-hanock-kindergarden-this-s.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m62cdq7I831r729pmo1_1280.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second stop of the day yesterday was at the Rev. P. Hanock Kindergarden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second stop of the day yesterday was at the Rev. P. Hanock Kindergarden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 'school' was a metal building that was a maximum of 12 feet by 12 feet and barely tall enough for Josh Martin to stand in.  This school housed 24 students, about half of which had chairs to sit in.  The students were prepared for us to come, and gave us a concert and a number of demonstrations of their ability to count, and name the colors and the shapes.  It was really impressive and they were all so eager to show off their knowledge.  From the very beginning they instill in these learners the importance of knowledge and going to school. "Knowledge is our future" they sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this small classroom there are outhouse facilities donated by Luther alums Orv and Cathy Johnson. The Luther connections here in Namibia are many and strong.  It is almost heartbreaking to see what a relatively small amount of money by American standards can accomplish over here.  We left the kindergarden some blocks and a soccer ball.  The look on the children's faces when they emerged from the building to kick the ball around was another of those moments that make you realize what this trip is all about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>a day at namibian schools</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-day-at-namibian-schools.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-22:/PelicanBlog/a-day-at-namibian-schools.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first stop on our free day in Windhoek was at the school for the blind.  We had brought two suitcases of brail books (many Goosebumps stories) with us to take to this school.  We drove up to the school on a short dirt road, and waited a few minutes …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first stop on our free day in Windhoek was at the school for the blind.  We had brought two suitcases of brail books (many Goosebumps stories) with us to take to this school.  We drove up to the school on a short dirt road, and waited a few minutes while Ann and Ethan went to check in with the principal.  It was a a really nice school.  Its interesting to see the design because the hallways between the classroom are all outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was walking in this young man introduced himself to me, his name was Simon.  I shook his hand and introduced myself as Brad, and before I knew it I was mobbed with students shaking hands and introducing themselves.  They were great and so polite and happy to meet us that it really made me feel happy that we were here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a tour of many of the classrooms.  We saw some very young students learning how to read braille by using a system of blocks.  Put the round blocks in the right holes for a particular letter.  The number of the hole corresponded to a key on the keyboard.  So if you put a block in hole 1 and 5 then you press keys 1 and 5 on your keyboard at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met many of the teachers.  None of whom had any particular training in teaching blind or deaf children.  They were all teachers who were just looking for an extra challenge and ended up here.  What the students lack in sight or hearing they make up for in their eagerness to learn.  Many of them, sadly, come from homes where their parents don't know how to cope with a disability and so they are suffering from very low self esteem or depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Anne, who is the computer teacher at the school.  She showed us their computers, which were extremely old.  However she couldn't turn any of them on because the school had been without power for several days.  They were promised that it would be back on by last night, but nobody really knows if that will be the case or not.  She said she mainly teaches them word and excel, but also tries to teach them a little bit of programming, "so that they know about algorithms."  When I asked her what language they program in, she said Turbo Pascal!  Jane and I both had the same reaction, I don't think people have been teaching pascal for years.  I told her a little about  my textbook project, and at the end of the day we left four laptops for the school, so hopefully the students can maybe start to learn a little Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Engelbrecht, was a young male teacher with a big smile who was just so happy to see us and walk around and talk with us and tell us about the school.  The Principal is a force of nature and at one point provided the quote of the day.  Right after we had finished singing to a group of second graders she remarked in a very pointed tone:  "Mr.Englebrecht, don't you have somewhere else you should be"  Apparently Mr. E was letting his own students run amok while talking to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the tour was when we sang to this second grade class.  They started clapping for us after the first time through and as I looked around our group I realized that I wasn't the only one singing with a lump in their throat.  The kids were just beaming with joy!  Apparently when they have visitors they usually do a little program, so for us to sing to them was something really special.  It was one of those moments that confirmed that this trip is all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the group stayed on at the school for the blind, but Gregory and I were off with Mr. Usko Shivute to visit the International University of Management.  We had a very nice meeting the leadership of the school, to see if there are any ways that we can collaborate.  ONe interesting fact we learned was that out of 180 some faculty only 7 have their PhD.  So they are very interested in Faculty development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our meeting we had a tour of the facilities, and we met the chief examination officer.  I was very interested to learn that all exams for all classes must be reviewed and approved by the examination officer's group.  Of course this means that you have to have all your exams made before the semester even starts.  I can't imagine teaching that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we went to UNAM -- the University of Namibia.  I had a meeting scheduled with the HOD of computer science.  Ms. Kauna Mufeti. The plan was for me to give a talk (A practice talk for me)  about the eBook project.  Sadly, the Dean had rescheduled the faculty meeting from morning to afternoon, so many of the people that would have been at the talk were now required to be at the faculty meeting -- which is compulsory.  Sadly for my Namibian counterparts they do not have a tenure system, so when the dean makes a faculty meeting compulsory, you really do have to go.  Nevertheless we had a great meeting together with a few people in the department and made some great connections.  I hope that we are able to arrange some kind of collaboration to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Gregory was supposed to meet with the HOD of music, but tracking down his counterpart was a bit more difficult.  In what Greg described as a typical Namibian sequence Kauna called person after person, office after office before we finally located someone for him to meet with.  It turned out to be just the right person, and so when he comes back in 2014 they will meet with some faculty at UNAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't get back to the Hotel Safari until almost 5:00.  So we had a few minutes to rest before enjoying a happy hour get together in the Peterson room.  We exchanged stories of the day and laughed together about our experiences with 'African Time' and then at 7:00 we headed out the door to Joe's beer shack.  This is a great restaurant, and quite famous in Windhoek.  Parts of the restaurant are open to the sky and have roaring campfires going to keep everyone warm in the cool Namibian night.  Other parts are covered, but all of it is great.  The menu is full of opportunities to try various kinds of African game.  I ended up with a dish that had Ostrich, Springbok, and Oryx.  Served in a white wine sauce with "A tot of Whitblit"  What is a tot of Whitblit you may ask   It turns out that the correct question to ask is how much is a tot?  A tot is roughly the same as a shot, so in the middle of all of this game you get a shot of some liquor called Whitblit, which my spell check keeps wanting to correct to whitebait -- somehow seems appropriate.  We had lots of fun with Ethan trying to surreptitiously take a picture of Ann sipping her Whitblit. Although she's officially retired, she seems to think she can keep Ethan from graduating if any pictures of the former Dean of Students are posted on Facebook.  I think Ethan may take that as a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others in the party had Zebra, Crocodile (a bit fishy) and other African game animals.  Maybe even a regular old beef stake.  We ate and laughed and had a great time.  When desert time finally came around there were many orders of Don Pedro -- which is a milkshake with some liquor added.  In our case we went with the Amarulo which is the African equivalent of Bailey's Irish Cream.  Delicious!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>okahandja woodcarvers market</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/okahandja-woodcarvers-market.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-22:/PelicanBlog/okahandja-woodcarvers-market.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here we are back on the bus after a stop at the woodcarvers market all of us laughing our heads off.  About 70km North of Windhoek we stopped at the woodcarvers market.  In my mind I had a vision of a sedate little market where Namibian men were sitting and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here we are back on the bus after a stop at the woodcarvers market all of us laughing our heads off.  About 70km North of Windhoek we stopped at the woodcarvers market.  In my mind I had a vision of a sedate little market where Namibian men were sitting and carving interesting wooden masks and bowls.  What ensued was the first "holy shit" comment of the day from one of our co-travellers.  While Jane went across the road to the market, I went to the coffee shop to get some coffee.  As Josh and I crossed the road I was approached my a young man who said "I have your wife"  A swarm of young men descended on us, come to my shop, come to my shop, the next 20 minutes were pure chaos of bargaining in both US$ and Namibian $.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the dust has settled a bit it appears that the best strategy is to offer somewhere less than half of what they first tell you is the price and work your way up as slowly as you can.  However, we all learned that the hard way.  Our first purchase of this manic shopping spree was a marble bowl.  The asking price was N$650, we countered with N$400 and settled at N$500.  Way to high.  As Jane was literally pulled out of that shop and on to another shop I saw an elephant hair bracelet.  I didn't have any Namibian dollars left so I told him I would buy it with US$.  He said $70 US for the bracelet.  I told him no way; but by then the bracelet was already on my arm.  So I told him the leather bracelet I had cost less than $20 he said make me an offer, so I told him $10.  But its made from Elephant hair!!  With that he wrote $50 on his arm.  No way, I said so I came up to $15.  Eventually we settled at $20.  I really do this is one of the best deals I've ever made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As all of this was taking place young men were trying to lure Mary (Ethan's mom) to the outskirts of their little woodcarving village.  Mary resisted with the help of her sister Carol who exclaimed, "I'm not letting you get sold into white slavery"  Mary was the smartest among us as all she purchased was a single woven basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jane was embroiled in making a bargain for a couple of giraffes.  We were rapidly running out of cash, and she was desperately trying to get back to the first stall where she had found a bowl she really liked.  We ended up with the giraffes and two bowls.  Now this young man grabbed the bowls and told us he'd wrap them for us.  As he was wrapping them he insisted that Jane look at the Salad tongs in his stall.  He proceeded to hold our bowls hostage until Jane finally bought two sets for US$10.  Meanwhile Josh was standing outside the stall saying Mom, we have to go, the bus is going to leave.  Apparently this is a common ploy as one young man was stuffing marble candle holders into Jerry's backpack.  Ann had to pull them out and pull Jerry out of the stall in order to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane is now trying to sell two of the salad tongs she bought to Josh Martin.  She told him she'd sell him the one pair for $20 US.  Just think of your mother she said!  If you brought these home to her she'd know you were thinking about her.  So, Karen, if you want some Namibian salad tongs just let us know, we'll make you a really good deal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at the end of the session we had spent about $100 US, or 800 Namibian dollars.  Even if we overpaid for every item it was well worth the price just for the experience.  Plus we figure we are helping these guys make their living and propping up the economy of Okahandja.  Josh Miller and Josh Martin were the only two people who didn't spend any money.  Josh had 20 people approach him, and he just kept telling them, I don't have any money. I don't have any money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch was the well timed trip to the 'Diamond Factory'  We learned a little about diamonds, and then had a tour of the showroom.  The tour began with some free glasses of Champagne and ended at the Tanzanite stand.  Long time readers of this blog may remember the Tanzanite story from Mexico and how that ended.  This was had a somewhat similar, though less expensive, ending to the story.  It seems fitting to get some Tanzanite while we're in Africa,especially since our 26th anniversary is only 2 days away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>heroe's acre</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/from-penduka-we-went-on-to-the-heroe-s-acre-this-is-a-huge-monument-to-commemora.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2012-06-20:/PelicanBlog/from-penduka-we-went-on-to-the-heroe-s-acre-this-is-a-huge-monument-to-commemora.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5xcfkvykt1r729pmo1_400.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first full day in country and our first day of touring the Windhoek area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started this morning at 9:00 with most of us sleeping in until 7:30 or 8:00.  You know we needed the sleep when we were able to overcome the jet lag that quickly.  We drove through the city and into the Katatura township, We are told that this township will be positively luxurious compared to some of the others we will see.  One thing we noticed was even though the poverty was obvious, there was very little litter and trash on the ground.  Everywhere you look you see tiny little shops, barber shops, hair salons, cell phone shops, Bars that are just big enough for a few people to squeeze in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Katatura we continued on the Penduka.  This is a sort of Women's collective where they make and sell all kinds of hand crafts.  Of particular interest was how they refashion old glass bottles into jewelry, particularly beaded jewelry.  The picture shows the kiln used to melt the glass and to fire the pottery.  We got a full tour of the place, and met a few of the women working on different projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we had such a long london layover we did leave the airport and take the tube into London.  We walked around the London School of Economics with Josh Martin, and then meandered through the South Bank area having lunch at Giraffe.  Yesterday was a hard day, the overnight flight with the 6 timezone change really messes you up.  This morning was easier as we flew mostly north to south, crossing only one time zone.  We are really thankful to the gate agent in Chicago who rearranged our seats on this flight so that we had the aisle seats in the middle section with nobody in between us.  We were able to stretch out and get some decent rest last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this trip.  This is not just a trip for fun, this is partly a mission trip and partly a cultural experience.  The trip is organized by Empowering Learners, a non profit organized by Ethan Schultz, and Ann Sponberg-Peterson.  The goal is to bring 24 laptop computers and 50 calculators to the Oshigambo high school in Northern Namibia.  We also carried along an assortment of Braille books, and Soccer balls to distribute along the way.  There are a total of 12 of us on the trip and we got all of this stuff along with us in carry on and checked baggage, we are definitely going to be a lot lighter on the drive home than we on the trip here.  Once we complete our business working with the high school we'll be visiting the Etosha Game Park and the Atlantic Coast in Swakopmund.  More detail to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now we are safely checked in at the Safari Court Hotel.  After two nights sleeping on airplanes and having our morning coffee in airports, we are all ready for a shower!   As a group we will have a little break before meeting with our tour guide for the trip and then heading to downtown Windhoek for a meal at a nice German restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="namibia"></category></entry><entry><title>iguazu falls postscript</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/iguazu-falls-postscript.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2011-03-24:/PelicanBlog/iguazu-falls-postscript.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow,  We were just here and just on this very same boat ride.  I wrote about it here:  &lt;a href="http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/hiking-in-iguazu-national-park.html"&gt;http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/hiking-in-iguazu-national-park.html&lt;/a&gt;.  Now today I find out that two American tourists have died doing that same excursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south entrance to Joshua Tree is only about 25 miles away from Indio, so its a short drive to get to the park.  But, once you are there you find out how huge the park is.  We drove another 23 miles through desert scrub before we got to some of the really interesting parts.  The Joshua Tree National Park is a mixture of climates, it is part Colorado Desert, and part Mojave Desert, microclimates abound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first big stop was at the Cholla cactus garden, its weird how these pictures almost look like they are underwater photos of coral!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;img title="IMAG0020.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_HhjcVDI/AAAAAAAAAQk/x5LD1VSaC3g/IMAG0020.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0020" width="359" height="600" /&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0016.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_k91ZpII/AAAAAAAAAQ4/etUUWx_C7N4/IMAG0016.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0016" width="200" height="119" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the national park there are these small mountain ranges that pop up out of nowhere that look like someone just drove in a huge dump truck and left a pile of rubble behind.  In fact these are all granite, and formed from volcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0021.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_N9vawnI/AAAAAAAAAQo/ZNN6A5zNAkI/IMAG0021.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0021" width="359" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all the different climates that are part of the park, the whole southern half of the park doesn't even have any Joshua Trees!  You have to wait until you get to a little higher elevation which is in the north and west part of the park.  Here's Jim and Karen standing under a very picturesque Joshua Tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0035.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_VAQN4rI/AAAAAAAAAQs/JiaZwTJ_N5s/IMAG0035.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0035" width="359" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joshua Tree gets its name from the mormon's who saw it and thought that it reminded them of the prophet Joshua stretching his arms heavenward.  In fact the "tree" is part of the Yucca family.  It has extremely sharp  points on the end of the leaves which the loggerhead shrike (a bird) uses to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBrwLn1_e4I"&gt;kill its prey&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last stop in the park was a great little hike in hidden canyon.  Here you can get a sense of how these little mountains were created out of blocks of granite.  Its amazing to see the Joshua Trees along with the scrub oak, and Juniper trees just growing out of the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0039.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_b0vIQEI/AAAAAAAAAQw/h5_I9tSeoRM/IMAG0039.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0039" width="400" height="239" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home, we drove through the wind farm in the San Gorgonio pass.  This is a great site for a wind farm as the wind blows here all the time.  There are more than 4000 turbines here that generate enough power for the entire Coachella valley!  There are turbines here of all ages, some very old and very small, some with two blades, for working in higher winds, and some very new and large turbines.  Poor Jim, we discovered too late that you can get tickets for a tour of the wind farm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0046.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_gx5dlcI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/HxV_bz2IVIg/IMAG0046.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0046" width="400" height="239" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its been a fun week, here in california with our friends Jim and Karen.  We rented bikes for the week from Big Wheel bikes and we've been on several rides.  Yesterday was a favorite, we rode from our house here to La Quinta (&lt;a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/30256922/"&gt;http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/30256922/&lt;/a&gt;)  Its nice and flat, and through plenty of busy roads, but the bike lanes here are nice and wide and all of the drivers are courteous  towards cyclists.  The greatest thing is that there are mountains everywhere you look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday we drove over the mountains to Temecula.  We had a beautiful view looking back into the Coachella Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="View 'IMAG0005' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/5556303038"&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0005" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5556303038_b943965a19.jpg" border="0" alt="IMAG0005" width="500" height="299" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a little while later we encountered some snow.  Yes, we came out here to get away from the snow only to drive into some in the mountains.  Its not nearly as bad as it is back home where the Twin Cities is getting hit with about a foot, and Kaia is getting even more than that in Moorhead.  Here's Jim, Karen, and Jane having a snowball fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="View 'IMAG0009' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/5556304556"&gt;&lt;img title="IMAG0009" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5556304556_e38ef2a5e0.jpg" border="0" alt="IMAG0009" width="500" height="299" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we had a fun day in Temecula we didn't really find any wine to fall in love with.  The best I tasted was the Viognier at Callaway.  We had some great pizza at the Temecula Pizza Company.  Half gorgonzola and pear, half turkey and cranberry with white sauce.  We also had a small pepperoni and sausage, just for the sake of scientific comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the plan is to go up the tram in Palm Springs and do some hiking in the mountains, then grab some lunch in downtown Palm springs.  From there who knows what the day will bring, we only have another 36 hours before we head back to the snow and cold, so we've got to make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

We are excited to get back to our friends and family in Decorah, yet we have had so much fun on this cruise, and we have actually met some great people as well.  Some of these people get to stay on the ship for the next leg of the cruise and as we think about our long day tomorrow and our overnight flight we are a bit jealous that we don't get to go through the Panama canal, and then fly home from Fort Lauderdale.  I'm amazed that I could even consider staying onboard for another two weeks, but we've learned that its really all about pacing (note to self, next time do not buy the unlimited drinks package.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cruise critic message boards really provide a great service.  Not only can you find good reviews and recommendations of the non-ship excursions, but we've met a lot of fun people, and have been able to enjoy excursions with people that we met online prior to the cruise. So to Carol and Mike, and Carol and Ralph, and Scott and Gai, and Kristine and Craig (our aussie friends)... Thanks!!  To Jonathan and Nancy and Jo, we look forward to the final Martini rankings, Aloha!  And to Shila and Yogi, Kim and Rico, Rachel and Howie, thanks again for the fun dinners!  Hopefully we'll cross paths with some of you again on a future cruise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, where have we been?  Here's the super-fast summary of our travels:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decorah to MSP with Jenkins, Thanks for the ride guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MSP to Dallas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dallas to EZE (Buenos Aires)  cross town transfer to Jorge Newberry and then on to Iguazu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two fantastic days at Iguazu falls.  If you are looking at this cruise or planning a trip to South America, do not skip Iguazu.  The views are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iguazu back to BA and on to the ship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BA to Montevideo, Uruguay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montevideo to Punta del Este&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punta del Este to Puerto Madryn -- Desert like climate but great penguins and sea lions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puerto Madryn to Cape Horn and the Ushuaia (Ushuaia gets my vote for favorite city of the trip)  Its the southernmost city of the world, and the hiking and views on our hike in Tierra del Fuego national park were just phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ushuaia to Punta Arenas... OK, but not that spectacular.  If you haven't seen penguins by now, you should definitely do the trip here to see the penguins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punta Arenas to Puerto Montt.  The port area is not spectacular, but once you get out into the country or to one of the other smaller neighboring cities its great.  Beautiful scenery.... second favorite city.  Of course the zip line ride really made this stop worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puerto Montt to Valparaiso to Santiago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Santiago to Dallas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dallas to MSP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ride home with Sandy Larsen!  Wow gone 16 days and no parking charges at the airport!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on board, we used up 435 minutes of internet time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We drank 2 bottles of wine :-)  or more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane won $700 at the craps table&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really enjoyed many of the shows onboard the Celebrity Infinity!  We had become pretty much jaded about cruise line entertainment, but the quality here was really high.  I missed having a magic show, but the music was mostly really great, except for the aging former Argentine star, who just doesn't realize its time to hang it up.  When you are on a cruise ship and you have to start your show with a video about how great you used to be, that is not a good sign!  Travis, from Nebraska, you rock.  The a cappella group top shelf was great too.  It was hard to listen to this recently graduated group of young guys without thinking about Kaia's future as a musical performer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No summary would be complete without some room pictures, so here are a few pics of our Celebrity Suite.  This suite will be redone when the ship is Solticized in November, but we thought it was perfect for this cruise.  Not only was the room spectacular, but our Butler, Teguh, was the most Amazing person.  No job was too big or too small, he really made our cruise seamless.  From sneaking into the room before I was awake every morning so that my coffee was hot and fresh on the table, to organizing a part for 20 in our room one night.  He was the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PJOMhXDI/AAAAAAAAAPY/PsUFK601Bv8/IMG_2543.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2543" title="IMG_2543.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PJpXrJJI/AAAAAAAAAPc/kB9mgIbKAyQ/IMG_2546.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2546" title="IMG_2546.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PK0iEIUI/AAAAAAAAAPk/kZFodvDVsJ0/IMG_2556.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2556" title="IMG_2556.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PKMDxmxI/AAAAAAAAAPg/H6iOyzx5yqw/IMG_2549.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2549" title="IMG_2549.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane says I can type and read at the airport tomorrow, so I think its time to get dressed for dinner one last time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2808293707145995482?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="southamerica2011"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>cruise wrapup part ii</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/cruise-wrapup-part-ii.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2011-03-15:/PelicanBlog/cruise-wrapup-part-ii.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been back in Decorah for less than 24 hours, its been a little more than 48 hours since we got off the cruise ship in Valparaiso.

It was great to get a good nights sleep last night after having an overnight flight from Santiago to Dallas.  Boy do I wish I could sleep on airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Celebrity debarkation process was about as painless as you could make it. We woke up, showered and dressed, got some coffee at the Cova Cafe, checked our email one last time, and then walked off the ship.  Like Buenos Aires, the port in Valparaiso is not really designed for cruise ships, so we got off the ship and then took a bus through the containers to the actual terminal.   We found our luggage right away and realized that this process was so efficient we still had about 45 minutes to wait before our guide, Mac, from &lt;a href="http://www.labicicletaverde.com/"&gt;La Bicicleta Verde&lt;/a&gt; It was a little odd this morning because Chile was supposed to go off daylight savings time at the same time the US was supposed to go on daylight savings.  So, in one day we would go from being 3 hours ahead of home to just one hour.  Strangely the government of chile decided at the last minute not to go off daylight savings time, so some people were really off.  Mac showed up just after 9:00, and we got our tour underway.  We started by exploring the hills of Valparaiso.  Its an old shipping town, started when Nitrates were a big natural commodity that was shipped out of here.  Before the Canal, and before artificial nitrates had been invented.  So there are many beautiful old shipping houses owned by the british that have been converted into small hotels.  Here you can see one last view of our ship from the hills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2559.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lgbWQR_I/AAAAAAAAAPs/qYK_mU8OK4g/IMG_2559.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2559" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on past the first Lutheran Church in Valparaiso, and then had to avoid a pack of street dogs.  All chilean cities are full of street animals that are well feed and mostly well behaved.  The problem this morning was there was one female in heat and four males that were trying to get her attention.  Things got a little violent, so we headed off in the opposite direction hoping to lose the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac told us that the day before this whole area of the city had been without power.  Now as you can see from this picture Valparaiso has a very modern system of electrical distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2566.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lhdhCiAI/AAAAAAAAAPw/T80lkZzXk3c/IMG_2566.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2566" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told that whenever there is a power loss, rather than trying to untangle the mass of wires and fix the problem, they simply find an area of the city that has power and then run a new wire to the blacked out area from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the hill tour we headed down the coastline to visit some of the beautiful coastal towns, suchas Vina del Mar.  This would be an awesome place to come back and visit on a land tour.  The beaches are spectacular, and there are some really awesome restaurants looking right out over the water.  Mac got us number one at the most popular restaurant along this stretch.  People literally line up outside this restaurant waiting for a table.  Something that is unheard of in Chile.  We started off with a couple of apetizers:  Machas ala parmesan (razor clams smothered in a parmesan cream sauce.)  The only way to sum up this dish is:  To Die For!  We also had Camerones pil pil (little shrimp scampi).  Then for the main course we had freshly prepared fish.  They have about 7 different kinds of fish on the menu, each one with several different preparations.  I had Albacora (swordfish) grilled, and Jane had the Corvina (chilean sea bass) also grilled.  We had a side of Arroz and thought we were in heaven.  What a great last meal of the trip.  Oh, lest I forget , I also had my first Pisco Sour.  Pisco Sour is a great chilean drink made of a distilled wine (kind of like brandy) served with lime juice and simple syrup.  Just one please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2569.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-liHkJ7eI/AAAAAAAAAP0/PeTTyYLJ17E/IMG_2569.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2569" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our delicious lunch we headed out to wine country.  The Casablanca valley is between Valparaiso and Santiago.  We stopped at the Emiliana Organic Vineyards, for a wine tasting and a walk around the vineyards.  We had a great wine steward, named Joshua, who served us samples of their premium Emiliana Adobe line.  This is sold in the United States under the Emiliana Natura label because of  a trademark dispute with the Adobe software company.  Please lawyers find something more productive to do with your time.  The highlight was their Gewurtztraminer, its not nearly as sweet as the German Gewurtztraminers and was very refreshing.  In addition to being organic they also practice Biodynamics (you'll have to look it up).  This sounds like a lot of hokum to me, but you can't argue with the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2574.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-ljPq7YOI/AAAAAAAAAP4/6L6V9pT56Iw/IMG_2574.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2574" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what trip would be complete without some cute animals.  The vineyard also raises Alpacas, which we learned are part of the Camel family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2585.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lj20NJvI/AAAAAAAAAP8/DyB6X7faf6c/IMG_2585.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2585" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vineyard tour over, our last stop was the Santiago airport.  We had lots of time to kill, since we got there about 5pm and our flight wasn't supposed to leave until 10:05.  Of course at 5:00 the American Airlines counters were not even open yet. Then at 6:00 when they opened it was a mad house.  hundreds of tired cruisers all anxious to get home, and all accustomed to being pampered for two weeks were now forced to stand in extremely long lines like so many commoners.  It was not pretty.  An interesting thing about flying out of Santiago is that all the outgoing flights leave in the evening, this is partly because you want to time your flight to get in to the states at a decent hour of the morning.  Say 6:00 AM or so.  But all the incoming flights get in to Santiago at 7 or 8 in the morning anyway, so why not have an outbound flight at 10AM?  By Chilean law, all outbound flights must have a complete mechanical inspection within 12 hours of their flight by a Chilean mechanical team.  The reason for this law dates back to 1972 when the Uruguayan rugby team crashed in the Andes and resorted to cannibalism to stay alive.  The Chilean legislature wanted to ensure that nothing like this would ever happen again so they passed this inspection law.  The result is that the flights that leave in the evening are never delayed for mechanical reasons, because they've had all day to inspect and fix everything.  Nice, makes you feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that brings us as far as our last flights, which were pretty uneventful.  A bit of turbulence somewhere between Santiago and Dallas is about the only thing worth mentioning.  This was an awesome trip.  Thanks again to all the great new friends we made on board the ship for making it a fun time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, this is not going to have a big impact on our trip. Out at sea, the tsunami is nothing but a big swell that we would ride up and over like any other large swell.  Its only when it gets toward land that it becomes the giant wall of water you see on the news. The captain is going about business as usual and we are on our way out of the harbor at Puerto Montt as I write this.  We have about 650 nautical miles from here to Valparaiso, and tomorrow we will spend a relaxing last day at sea.  If we were the tsunami, we would be able to get there in just a little over an hour!  According to news reports the wave traveled from japan toward Hawaii and the west coast of the US at over 500 mph.  The pictures of Japan on the news are just unbelievable, but again it appears that distance will sufficiently weaken the tsunami to the point where we will not be affected at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets turn our attention to our fabulous day here in Puerto Montt!  We got to check off a bucket list item today.  What could that be you ask?   Zip Lining!  The highlight of todays tour was going to the top of a volcano, and then riding a series of zip lines to the bottom.  When we arrived on the pier this morning it was quite overcast and the owner of the tour company warned us that with the rain from last night and the wind today we might be out of luck.  But we took off in our little bus and headed for Lago Llanguihue, this is a huge vacation lake that sits below the volcanoes.  And when we arrived at the base of the ski lift on the volcano it appeared that we might in fact be out of luck.  Here's a view of what the side of the volcano/ski area looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2473.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqX0iHLHrI/AAAAAAAAAO8/JMf5VBQolOI/IMG_2473.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2473" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were clearly in and above the cloud line, and it was really eerie to see the wisps of clouds, that looked like steam rising from the dark sides of the volcano.  Our guide told us that we would not be allowed to go because of the wind.  So, we just hung out for a while looking at the clouds and suddenly we noticed that the sky towards the top was starting to clear.  Suddenly the chair lift even started running.  Our guide came out and said OK team lets head down and we'll go into Puerto Vargassafsf for some shopping and a nice lunch.  Wait!  a couple of the women (including jane) said.  Can't we at least ride up the chair lift?  Of course I'm thinking you guys are mad, why would we want to ride higher up into the clouds to just see more clouds.  So our guide told us to wait and she would check.  Miraculously, now the 'experts' were out checking the zip lines to see if they were safe.  The verdict came back that it was safe, so a few of us decided to follow the original plan and go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the top of the ski lift we were treated to the following view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2496.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqX8LWOwjI/AAAAAAAAAPA/Zuh96Wv5Jtc/IMG_2496.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2496" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly you can see the clouds had dissipated and we had a fantastic view of the top of the volcano, and its glacier.  It took us a few minutes, as the guy working at the top of the lift did not speak any english, but we eventually located our zip lining guides.  They got us into our harnesses and led us to the top of the launching pad for our very brief (10 seconds?) safety briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:   hold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Si&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:  break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Si&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:  No touch the cable, only here and the break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Si&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And off you go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's Jane and our friend Scott before we got our helmets.  Those harnesses are certainly stylish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2484.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqYAyClIJI/AAAAAAAAAPE/8oIy5boEdg4/IMG_2484.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2484" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now here's Jane on her first run of the day.  Yes kids thats your mother hanging by a thread from a long thin piece of cable..  Don't worry she's having the time of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2486.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqYEx22OBI/AAAAAAAAAPI/3vNQbo2GBJc/IMG_2486.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2486" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now here's one of me coming in for a landing after our longest ride.  The span of this ride was 600 meters!  The total ride time was about 38 seconds which means our average speed was 15.78 meters/second or about 35 mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2519.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqYOBwCnPI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/g945yXZ8Cis/IMG_2519.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2519" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, we got to go on four different runs, each was great and very exhilarating.  We had an adrenaline rush for a good hour after we were all done, talking excitedly in the bus all the way back down the volcano.  A great day and a lot of fun.  Can't wait to try it again sometime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got back from the workout room.  walking up the stairs was quite an adventure.  At times I felt like I was floating up two to three stairs at a time, and at other times, I felt like I was carrying an elephant on my back as I was trying to go up a single stair.  Bootcamp was postponed this morning due to the high seas.  I decided to go ahead on run on the elliptical, which was kind of fun with all the dipping and plunging the ship was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be at sea today, and tomorrow, although later today and all of tomorrow we will be cruising through the Chilean Fjords. The Fjords will be much calmer than the open ocean.  I'm not sure whether or not to even attempt to go to bootcamp workout in these high waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we were in Punta Arenas.  It was our first stop in Chile.  We did not do any kind of excursion or tour.  We just took the tender to shore and walked around the town a bit.  There was a nice park square with trees, and a statue of Magellan, and handicrafts.  Apparently you are supposed to kiss the toe of Magellan and you will come back again, but with the crew having you sanitize your hands every five minutes, I can't imagine why anyone would want to kiss the toe of a statue and share the germs of a hundred other travelers that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were in town we found an internet cafe, where for the price of a cup of coffee we could get all the free internet we wanted.  It was nice to have some high speed internet for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just got back from a tour of the bridge.  It was very interesting and one of the officers confirmed that the wind was very strong this morning.  He said the maximum gust was 99 knots.  Thats about 113 mph for you non-nautical types.  So what do you do when you have a twelve story floating building and the wind is blowing against one side of the building at 113 mph?  Several things, it turns out.  The ship has stabilizers that can be deployed to counteract the forces of the wind.  These protrude out of the ship under the water at an angle like long wings that are under the water.  In addition there is water ballast that can be pumped from one side of the ship to the other to counteract the wind and the seas.  So when you consider that we had a strong current, 15 foot waves, and strong winds gusting to over 100 mph its amazing how little rocking and rolling the ship actually did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of photos I snapped while we were on the bridge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2431.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXjbh0HJ9qI/AAAAAAAAAOs/pkGU1w4_I9k/IMG_2431.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2431" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are back we are also getting ready to host a little party in our room for some of the people we've met on board.  The party will start here, and then we'll also visit some of the rooms and suites that others have.  This is a great way to see what kind of room you might like to have the next time you come on board.  Here's a shot that I took on the balcony of our friends Jonathan and Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky today and got a day when the seas were relatively calm, and the skies were quite clear.  Here you can see Jane and I on the east side of the island.  In the background you can kind of make out the weather station.  There is also the Chilean flag, and the Albatross Monument.  This is a monument to all the sailors who have died trying to navigate around Cape Horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2232.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYnSVjj3WI/AAAAAAAAAOg/FnC1yYaIGOk/IMG_2232.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2232" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather around the cape is very unpredictable.  In the span of less than an hour it went from the rather nice, as seen in the picture above to the somewhat sinister as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2263.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYnXn-5tkI/AAAAAAAAAOk/Y0NjY6jXQu8/IMG_2263.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2263" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I think to myself,  here we are on this enormous cruise ship, you'd have to be insane to do this on the size ship that the early explorers used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to catch you up a bit.  We've been at sea the last two days.  Its very relaxing except that I caught a nasty cold and have been mostly just laying around and taking hits off my inhaler.  Between the bouts of chills, I've gone to a few of the excellent lectures they do on board the ship.  Two retired college profs who get to sail around the world with celebrity giving lectures on the science and nature of the area we are visiting.  Not a bad retirement gig if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jane has been a demon in the casino.  She's been rolling the dice at the craps table and is way ahead of our meagre $200 gambling allowance.  Now you might be thinking that there is still plenty of time to lose it all.  The thing is our strategy is to squirrel away the winnings and then go back to the table with the original amount again the next night.  I know some people would say double down, you don't have anything to lose (except the original $80 that we planned on losing anyway)  But our Norwegian Lutheran heritage just doesn't roll that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2348.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm0kGV83I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jsqcdTXP2Nk/IMG_2348.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2348" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ushuaia is the southernmost city in the world we are not as far south as you might imagine our latitude is only as far south as Washington DC is north, so there are no issues with permafrost or any of the other problems that plague the far north cities.  Interestingly though, there are glaciers very near the city, and we cruised by them and hiked near them today.  Ushuaia is located on the Beagle channel.  This is the channel that the famous ship carrying Charles Darwin discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day in Ushuaia was full of hiking with people we've met from Cruise Critic.  There were 11 of us that had joined in a private tour with Christine and Craig from Australia.  Our driver and guide, Edgar, was very pleasant, and knowledgeable.  He stayed awake the entire trip!  He hiked with us and pointed out interesting plants and things along the way.  Our main hiking was in the Tierra del Fuego National Park.  Here are a couple of photos to give you an idea of how pretty it was.  Jane and I are going to try to find an Internet Cafe in Punta Arenas so hopefully with some speedier connectivity I can get some larger versions uploaded to Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2299.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm3kkQ49I/AAAAAAAAAOM/MHuuLnWYEtM/IMG_2299.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2299" width="400" height="265" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2314.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm6gp-nXI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/rF5bL41pAa0/IMG_2314.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2314" width="398" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things I discovered on the hike was how similar this area is compared to northern minnesota.  Its striking how the effects of the glaciers leave exactly the same marks even though we are in completely different parts of the world.  In some places you would think you were on the shores of lake superior instead of standing next to the Beagle Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiking in the national park all morning, we got in the van and drove to the ski area above the city.  Here we were able to take a ski lift up the mountain to another hiking area.  If we had more time we could have continued to hike up the mountain to the glacier.  Sadly, the hike was too long and we didn't want to miss the ship!  While we were doing a short hike at the top of the lift we were lucky enough to see an Albatross soaring in the sky.  These birds are huge, with wingspans of up to 3.5 meters!  Sadly it was too far away to get a decent picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a shot of the view on the way down the ski lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2377.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm-BBpIAI/AAAAAAAAAOU/ke3BdLTab4k/IMG_2377.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2377" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here you can see our ship on the pier with the city in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I would say that Ushuaia is my favorite city of the cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp;A large unforrested region of grassland. &amp;nbsp;This was a combination of small shrubs and sand. &amp;nbsp;In other words there is really nothing interesting to see on this drive, except for the occasional Guarananca or Piche -- but I'm getting ahead of myself. &amp;nbsp;Well, not really, there were two destinations for todays trip. &amp;nbsp;First, the San Lorenzo Penguin Colony, and second Punta Norte Sea Lion and Elephant Seal colonies. &amp;nbsp;Oh yeah, the last 76km to the Punta Norte are on gravel road.&lt;br /&gt;So after riding most of the way in silence, we are approaching the Penguin colony and our guide says. &amp;nbsp;"In a few moments we will be at the penguin colony, here is a penguin" &amp;nbsp;At which point he pulls out a picture of a penguin. &amp;nbsp;He continues: &amp;nbsp;"Penguins are black and white, with a white band up here (pointing to the white band on their head) and a black band here (pointing to the black band). &amp;nbsp;I think both Jane and I were struggling to keep a straight face at this point, but one of us managed to say "interesting." &amp;nbsp;Of course what he didn't know is that this was "interesting" in the Iowa/Minnesota sense of the word. &amp;nbsp;Here concludes the fascinating section of the commentary on penguins. &amp;nbsp;To summarize: &amp;nbsp;They are black and white and have two bands.&lt;br /&gt;Let me add a bit more detail that I learned on my own, and from the lecture given by the naturalist on board the Infinity... &amp;nbsp;The penguins that we were about to see are called Magellanic Penguins, named for Magellan who sailed these parts back in the late 1500's. &amp;nbsp;Maybe now you are getting a sense for the title of this post? Ferdinand? &amp;nbsp;Ferdinand? &amp;nbsp;anyone? anyone? &amp;nbsp;Yes, Ferdinand Magellan! &amp;nbsp;I'm so clever.&lt;br /&gt;I know I'm sounding a little snarky about the tour today, but it really turned out just fine. &amp;nbsp;because we were just the two of us on our own tour, we got to the Penguin colony well ahead of the masses, in fact we had the place all to ourselves, and that made it worth it right there. &amp;nbsp;Would I have liked some more insightful commentary? &amp;nbsp;Sure. &amp;nbsp;But the kid was sincere and earnest so its hard to be too upset with him. &amp;nbsp;If I'm upset with anything its with Forastero tours for sending us a rookie.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, without further ado, here are some penguin pics for you! &amp;nbsp;yes, we were up close and personal with the penguins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2142" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIbpLUmLQI/AAAAAAAAANo/0d9U-mlpX5U/IMG_2142.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2142.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little guy was not happy. &amp;nbsp;I think he was hungry and Mom was not coming through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2156" border="0" height="102" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIbvXmGNaI/AAAAAAAAANs/SOYW4Y-2cdY/IMG_2156.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2156.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2159" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIb2W-QNSI/AAAAAAAAANw/iIn_xRa97pk/IMG_2159.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2159.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Penguins we continued further up the road to Punta Norte where we saw both Sea Lions and Elephant Seals. &amp;nbsp;Punta Norte is the only place in the world where you can see the Elephant seals. &amp;nbsp;At other times of the year, and at high tide, you also stand a chance of seeing an Orca coming into try and catch a baby Sea Lion, but no such luck today. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, here's a shot of the beach, you can see the Sea Lions down below. &amp;nbsp;the Elephant seals are way on the far right end of the coast here and we could see them with the binoculars, but not so well with the camera lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2164" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIcCNltwGI/AAAAAAAAAN4/b4NId_TBBrU/IMG_2164.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2164.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching the Sea Lions we found a nice place to sit and enjoy some sandwiches for lunch. &amp;nbsp;While we were eating lunch the friendly neighborhood Armadillo (piche en espanol) came around hoping we would share with him, or her Im not sure how you tell with Armadillos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2195" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIcI0hzdhI/AAAAAAAAAOA/ZyUENnHzcdw/IMG_2195.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2195.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last and final episode with our young guide happened on the way back to the ship. &amp;nbsp;We had to take the exact same route back to the ship that we followed to get to Punta Norte, but lets just say the ride seemed shorter for some people than for others. &amp;nbsp;Yep, he actually &lt;strong&gt;fell asleep&lt;/strong&gt; on the ride back! &amp;nbsp;I think the driver was ready to reach across, open the door and push him out.&lt;br /&gt;Its funny how all of our excursions involve both a driver and a guide. &amp;nbsp;In each case we are led to believe that the driver does not speak english. &amp;nbsp;In this case I'm pretty sure the driver was much more experienced than the actual guide, as he seemed to know many of the other guides at Punta Norte. &amp;nbsp;Furthermore I think he understood and probably spoke english just fine. &amp;nbsp;He also did an excellent job of scanning the countryside and the road ahead for interesting animals. &amp;nbsp;We could tell that he was the one who would spot them and then tell our guide what was coming up. &amp;nbsp;His job today was to give junior some feedback on his first outing. &amp;nbsp;I'm pretty sure he got an earful!&lt;br /&gt;The day ended on a very positive note. &amp;nbsp;Jane got on a roll at the craps table and ended the night over $400 ahead. &amp;nbsp;She made a lot of other people at the table very happy too.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1832043447776667251?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="southamerica2011"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>biking punta del este</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/biking-punta-del-este.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2011-03-03:/PelicanBlog/biking-punta-del-este.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The city of Punta Del Este has about 10,000 regular inhabitants, even though when you look at the picture of it you could easily imagine that it hosts ten times that number.  This is because Punta Del Este is a huge vacation getaway for much of South America.  All …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The city of Punta Del Este has about 10,000 regular inhabitants, even though when you look at the picture of it you could easily imagine that it hosts ten times that number.  This is because Punta Del Este is a huge vacation getaway for much of South America.  All of the apartments in the high rise buildings are vacation homes.  Punta Del Este itself is mostly situated on a big peninsula with beaches on both sides.  The beaches on the west side are at the Platta river, the same one that starts in Brazil and flows through the Tigre Eelta north of Buenos Aires.  The beaches on the east are on the Atlantic ocean, and you can see the fresh and salt water mix together off the tip of the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2071.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_cGp7TLI/AAAAAAAAANM/sGh4oYd-uk0/IMG_2071.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2071" width="600" height="397" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't have anything in particular planed for our day in Punta del Este, so we just took the tender ashore with the idea that we would walk around and check things out.  However when we got off the ship and started our walk through town, there it was, Bike Tours!  One lone woman holding a bike tour sign, of course we had to check it out.  Her name was Alice and she said she could take us on a two hour tour of the city, tell us about the history and highlights of the area, and of course we would do it all on bike.  Yay!  The price was very reasonable too, so here's my digital shout-out to &lt;a href="http://www.biketoursuruguay.com"&gt;Bike Tours Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; Its a great way to see the town, and Alice even has other longer tours that will take you north into some of the other outlying areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got our bikes, helmets, and water our first stop was the most famous work of art in Punta del Este.  The "hand in the sand"  This was a sculpture that won a big art contest sponsored by the city back in the mid 1980's.  It is literally a giant stone hand coming out of the sand on the beach.  Here's Jane and I in front of the middle finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2063.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_ecn92YI/AAAAAAAAANQ/FPCA-Mjyz20/IMG_2063.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2063" width="400" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued our tour down the atlantic side enjoying the sites and sounds of the beaches.  The picture at the top is taken looking north back up the beach.  When you get to the point of the peninsula there is an observation deck to go out on, where you can enjoy the view looking back up the river as well as out to sea.  On the atlantic side there is an island where many hundreds of sea lions live, that is another tour for another day...  Some of our dinner table mates took that tour and said it was fun but pretty smelly when you get in amongst all of the sea lions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to the point our guide pointed out the island, and a small marker right off the point, and then another landmark off the the west.  According to the guide there is a large but rather narrow triangle  described by these three points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this triangle is one of the places on earth that has amazing energy.  Oops, now I'm thinking what kind of strange new age mumbo jumbo guide did we get ourselves mixed up with.  But stay with me for a minute.   This triangle also encompasses the Punta del Este lighthouse, seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2085.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_gpL7RTI/AAAAAAAAANU/jmT4GtB7xdY/IMG_2085.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2085" width="400" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, right next to the lighthouse is a little park area with a compass rose made out of stone.  You can see Jane standing on the compass rose facing south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2086.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_jUpn5lI/AAAAAAAAANY/Q5eD6bKF00A/IMG_2086.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2086" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the remarkable thing.  When you stand on the center of the compass rose and begin to speak you experience something really amazing.  Its like your voice echos inside your head in a really strong resonant way.  When our guide told us about this I was extremely skeptical.  I could just hear her telling me,  "What you couldn't feel it?  Its so strong I can't believe you didn't experience the power...."  But when I stood there and started talking it was amazing.  I'm not sure what causes it, but I did do some googling and apparently there are some strong magnetic forces that converge in the Punta del Este area that have been scientifically investigated.  When I get home I'm going to have to do some more research to see if I can figure out what might cause this internal acoustic effect.  (unless of course Mike has it figured out for me first)  If you have any theories of your own, please leave them in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued to bike around the peninsula, and up the river side.  We stopped at the fish market to see some sea lions, getting a late lunch, and from there we also had a great view of our ship as seen through many of the ships in the marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2100.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_lQh0zZI/AAAAAAAAANc/odwHoPfp-OU/IMG_2100.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2100" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea Lions at the fish market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2111.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_nfTrXQI/AAAAAAAAANg/3Sn7dhY--tI/IMG_2111.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2111" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a day where we had absolutely nothing planned this turned out to be a great adventure.  Seeing a city by bike is great, it gives you a good perspective and allows you to see the sites from outside, rather than being stuck inside a car or van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are at sea the whole day, on our way to Puerto Madryn.  There are lots of activities scheduled, and lots of time for reading and relaxing today.  We are looking forward to a nice quiet day -- After we go to our first boot camp workout!  The ship is also hosting a get together for all of the people on the Cruise Critic message boards, so that will also be a chance to meet some people in person that we have only communicated with electronically.  So, goodbye for now, I'll give you an update in a couple of days when we are through Puerto Madryn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

We had a white blend, along with a rose, a merlot, and a red blend. &amp;nbsp;We asked to try their Chardonnay and their Malbec, unfortunately they only had the chardonnay left for tasting; it was good but I actually liked the white blend we tried originally better.&lt;br /&gt;After the tasting, we were all tired... Big surprise right! &amp;nbsp;But we had a little more touring left to do. &amp;nbsp;We climbed montevideo's only large hill where we were treated to a great view of the harbor and our ship. &amp;nbsp;Its right in the middle of the photo below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2032" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW6skNRUbgI/AAAAAAAAANE/HZDR9sXvcwM/IMG_2032.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2032.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a nice tour. &amp;nbsp;Last night was the first formal night on the ship, and it was fun to get out the old tuxedo again and enjoy some good food and a nice show, iBroadway. &amp;nbsp;Jane and I can both check frog legs off the list of foods we have tried. &amp;nbsp;Guess what? &amp;nbsp;They taste like chicken.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6271555744286021478?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="southamerica2011"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>buenos aires</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/buenos-aires.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-03-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2011-03-01:/PelicanBlog/buenos-aires.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful two days in Buenos Aires.  Lets start with moving in to our room on the ship.  Other than the taxi driver overcharging us dumb Americans for the ride from the airport to the Puerta de Crucera everything about the checkin process went very well.  Our room …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful two days in Buenos Aires.  Lets start with moving in to our room on the ship.  Other than the taxi driver overcharging us dumb Americans for the ride from the airport to the Puerta de Crucera everything about the checkin process went very well.  Our room is great, we have this curved wall of windows that makes you feel like you are just suspended out over the water.  Our sitting area is really a great place to just hang out and watch the sea go by.  The luggage all arrived intact, and we were even able to smuggle a few bottles of wine we picked up at the airport onto the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had two nice surprises on checkin:  First, our room is close enough to the Internet Cafe that we actually get a wireless signal in the room, and because we are in a suite we get 180 minutes of free wireless.  That may not last the whole trip but its a good start.  The second surprise was that we had a complimentary meal at the SS United States for our first night on the ship.  This is the only specialty restaurant on board, and it is definitely a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard to choose from the menu there were so many good options.  I had Diver Scallops wellington with truffle emulsion, Lobster Bisque, Surf &amp;amp; Turf (more lobster tail for the surf part) and of course chocolate souffle for desert.  Jane had similar except she had a pear and goat cheese tart instead of the diver scallops, and a salad instead of the bisque. We washed it all down with a nice bottle of Far Niente Chardonnay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were leaving the restaurant the cruise director happened to be outside the door taping a segment for the next days onboard news and information channel.  We waited until we though it was safe for us to sneak by him inconspicuously, but that was not to be.  He spotted us and pulled us over for a quick on camera interview about our dining experience.  So, now we are famous for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second day in BA was even better than the first.  The main activity for the day was a delta river cruise.  Just north of Buenos Aires is a huge river delta, formed by the Plata river as it finishes its journey from the mountains of brazil and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.  We met our tour guides out front of the cruise terminal and they drove us through the city, pointing out interesting sites along the way.  Actually our driver and the owner of the company, Gaston, didn't say too much since he did not speak English, but our guide and interpreter did a great job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the Marina and got on board the boat.  It was a beautiful new 30 foot cabin cruiser, perfect for river cruising.  We took off up one of the main channels and just cruised along enjoying the sun and warm weather.  We laughed a bit at the fact that there are actually billboards along the side of the channel.  This gives you an idea of the amount of water traffic that uses this part of the river.  In fact the delta is home to a lot of people who commute by boat, and is the equivalent of going up to the lake for many other BA residents.  Everything in the delta uses water for transportation.  Everything from grocery delivery to garbage pickup is done by water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need some groceries?  You just put a bag over the end of a pole on your dock and the grocery boat will stop for you.  On garbage day you just hang your bags of garbage out on the end of the dock and the garbage boat takes them away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_1961.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWzESZaSOZI/AAAAAAAAAMs/jZpA4wQhhIU/IMG_1961.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1961" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After cruising through some residential areas we anchored in a very peaceful side channel to have some lunch... A nice local cerveza and some meat and cheese.  It was good, and light, which was perfect since we were still plenty full from our meal the night before.  Note to mike and Sarah, We signed up for six sessions of boot camp while we are on board, and although the first session was during our tour, we did work out before hand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tour we got dropped off in downtown Buenos Aires where we walked through the busy city streets, and looked at the shops and bought a souvenir for Josh.  Josh:  check out the Buenos Aires football clubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we had the obligatory lifeboat drill, but then we enjoyed our sail away from Beuenos Aires in our room:&lt;img title="IMG_1981.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWzEW2wJ5fI/AAAAAAAAAM0/m4tAHMhdCYk/IMG_1981.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1981" width="400" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At dinner we went to our regular table in the main dining room, its located right next to the windows on the very back of the ship next to the captains table.  There was a little mixup at first with 10 of us thinking we belonged at this table for 8.  The waiter got that sorted out by moving this english couple to their proper table.  It seems that they were seated at our table the night before when 6 of us were eating at other places.  We really seem to have a nice table:  One couple from Houston TX, another from Ohio, she is the dean of a small college,  and another couple from New Jersey.  We had very good conversation, and it looks like it will be fun to get together and compare notes with them each night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we neared the bottom of the trail we spotted a pair Toucans up in the tree, along with several other interesting birds. You can see the Toucan in the picture below.   At this point we were also able to buy our tickets for the boat trip under the falls....  But first there was a walkway that went right up to the falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="P2250043.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8EwDXVqI/AAAAAAAAAMM/7SUiVNXfKiM/P2250043.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Toucan Sam" width="600" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the person in the mist in the picture below.  This was one of those wild kingdom kind of moments..  In your best Marlin Perkins voice you can say:  "While Jane stays safely dry at the beginning of the platform Brad will tame the raging river and get drenched."  And this was the experience that literally took my breath away.  You just can't believe the force of the falls until you get right up to it like I did.  The wind that is created by the crashing of the water is like being in a thunder storm, and before I even realized what was going on, I was completely soaked from head to toe.  Between the force of the wind, and the perceived force of the water my breath just went right out of my lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="P2250051.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8G4fW_CI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/Lb-8VTD8Ktk/P2250051.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Brad in the falls" width="450" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I think about my own experience standing at the end of the platform, I have to wonder about the people that built this thing!  Who in their right mind would go to work each morning,  to build something where you were thinking that if you slipped, (and I'm sure that during construction it was plenty slippery) you would get smashed against the rocks below you by water with thousands of pounds of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is lots of wildlife in the park, we saw many species of birds, and a little hamster size rodent.  Others in our group saw a snake eating a frog -- sorry I missed that one.  But the most prevalent creature were these little things that we though were ringtail lemurs, but the locals had a different name for them.  Here's one of them begging lunch off another tourist.  Their snouts are quite long, and we were told that they are a member of the anteater family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_1865.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8YZyoY5I/AAAAAAAAAMg/ZsFzI9z3nGA/IMG_1865.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="lunch" width="600" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our experience on the platform, our next goal was the boat ride.  On this ride you get some great views of the falls from the river, and assuming you have a waterproof camera, some good pictures.  Then after you have seen the beauty of the falls the captain of the boat plays a game called "lets see how close to the falls we can get without going under."  In the picture below you can see the boat ahead of us headed into the falls.  I'll admit that when I was standing on dry land and watching this I was thinking to myself, "who in their right mind would get into a boat and do that?"  But, when we were actually in the boat it seemed perfectly safe, and the boat was very stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="P2250055.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8I6kXWUI/AAAAAAAAAMU/eNaogClPgDw/P2250055.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Into the falls" width="600" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane had the Flip video camera inside a waterproof bag when we got on the boat but mostly the video is a wall of white, and sound.  Here's a little bit of video from when we are near the falls, but not yet in the roiling water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="VID00030.MP4" src="marsedit://pending/29C2A8FB-AD3E-4932-9B9C-B84C6917C8C2/" border="0" alt="Falls Video" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were really glad we did the boat ride, as we got to see the even larger Brazilian falls that you can't see from the hiking trails in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiking back up to the hotel, we picked up my camera and got a new battery for the waterproof camera and set out for the train ride to El Diablo, this is another cool little hike where you go out to the top of the very large falls, and stand and watch the water spill over.  The water levels are quite high this year which makes everything even more spectacular.  Here's a couple of shots from the top of the falls.  Again, there are more without me in them on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157626145929036/"&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_1855.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8WELR3nI/AAAAAAAAAMc/0Zx2PlJLpHo/IMG_1855.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1855" width="600" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all of this hiking in the Jungle heat and humidity, we were quite tired and hot, so we headed back to the pool at the hotel to relax and rest up for a while.  Our final stop of the day was back in the city of Puerto Iguazu where we had a dinner reservation at Aqva restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We booked a round trip cab ride (200 pesos) at the front desk, which turned out to be a great deal.  We had a very personable cab driver named Ronny, who took us for a little site seeing and shopping before dropping us off at the restaurant.  After dropping us off he waited for us to eat and then took us back to the hotel.  Before dinner we had a beautiful view of the river from the city, where you can see Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay at the three corners of where the river splits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is decorated in Pacific Northwest style, and the food is a great blend of Argentinian and Italian cuisine.  We had a fantastic meal of Argentine steak and a lovely bottle of Malbec.  My steak came with a leak tart which was surprisingly delicious, and Jane had potatoes that were stuffed with cheese and ham.  The service was top notch, and we had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Jorge Antonio, who was very nice.... We topped off our dinner with a tiny bit of Limoncello.  The Limoncello was quite possibly the best we have ever tasted, so we asked the owner if he made it himself or imported it from Italy.  He said he made it himself and promised to share his top secret recipe with us if we sent him an email.  Just when we thought we were ready to leave the owner brought us a complimentary glass of Argentinian champagne to keep us happy for the ride back to the hotel.  If you get to Iguazu you should definitely check out Aqva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Decorah with our friends John and Llew at 8:00AM to drive to the airport, we have several plans for getting back from the airport -- the nice thing is that we didn't need to park our car at $20 per day for 16 days.  While we are away Josh and our God daughter Liz are in charge of the house.  Decorah friends take note of that last sentence!  We are flying American all day, and of course the first face I see when we get to the American Counter is the infamous Cat -- see my first post from JTerm travels.  Luckily we got our luggage checked in just fine without her.  When we got to the gate we checked with the gate agent to see if we could change our seats on the Dallas to Buenos Aires portion of the flight.  I really wanted to find a seat with a power port.  Nine hours in the air could require a recharge of the iPad.  She was so nice that she moved us to a bulkhead/exit row seat -- nine hours of legroom!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the air travel was uneventful, and we arrived in BA right on time.  Jane and I both managed at couple of hours of napping during the night, but nothing particularly restful.  BA is 3 hours ahead of central time so jet lag is not going to be a big factor.  Once off the plane we had to go through immigration and passport control.  We have to pay $140 each to visit Argentina, this is listed as reciprocity for the Visas that we make the Argentinians pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to get through immigration as quickly as possible and get on our car to the other airport (Jorge Newberry) where we are taking a flight to Iguazu for two days before the cruise.   We had reserved the 3:05 flight but were really hoping to get to the airport in time for the 11:35 flight.  We knew it would be tight but were hoping to avoid spending valuable hours in the airport.  Here's where the plan started to fray...  After paying our reciprocity fee we got shunted out of the line for people from the US into the line for Argentinians and other visitors.  This line ended up being much longer and slower.  As the minutes ticked away we resigned ourselves to an afternoon in the airport.  We did meet two very nice women who were traveling alone, one was going to antarctica as part of an academic expedition and the other was celebrating her birthday by going horseback riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up sharing our car with Denise -- the horseback rider -- The drive from BA International to Jorge Newberry is supposed to take anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours depending on who you read and what time of day, our drive was a harrowing 45 minutes.  Drivers here make up their own lanes and rules as they go along.  We got to the airport just after 11:00 which we were sure was too late for the 11:35 flight.  But luck was with us and the flight was delayed by an hour, so we were able to change to the earlier flight  -- with no change fee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cleared security and found our way to gate 3 where we met up with several people from the cruise critic message board, I'll just call them the CC people until I get to know them better.  Jane has been conversing online with some of these people for almost a year, and it was fun to meet up with some fellow americans to pass the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the Iguazu airport, and the plane parked at one of the two gates.  We waited forever for Jane's bag, and then got a cab to the Sheraton, which is located in the Iguazu National Park.  To summarize, we left Decorah at 8:00AM on the 24th and we arrived in Iguazu at 3:00 on the 25th.  A long days of travel! Just as we left the airport it started to rain, hard!  But, by the time we got checked in to our room and started to think about what to do with the rest of the day the rain stopped again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iguazu is amazing!  The falls here are huge, you just can't believe the volume of water that pours over these things every second.  For those of you as old as me who are into movies at all, these falls are the sight of the movie The Mission.  Here's one picture to whet your appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_1817_8_9_tonemapped.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWjg4GvZGAI/AAAAAAAAAME/U9X7A0KvYc8/IMG_1817_8_9_tonemapped.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1817 8 9 tonemapped" width="400" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this one on what is called the upper falls hike.  Its probably the driest hike we are going to take.  Next up is the lower falls hike which I will do in my swimsuit, and a boat ride that goes right up to the falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish off the story of our first day, we met up with the CC group again to have a drink in the hotel bar and dinner together.  I think this is going to be very nice to know a few people going into the cruise.  The dinner was pretty good.  Jane had seafood risotto and I had a nice Argentine steak.  The funniest thing was that Jane got dripped on through a leak in the roof when the rain started up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never wanted to be home so badly in all my life.  The group of 16 is sitting here in the American Eagle concourse of Laguardia.  We are at the airport very early for several reasons.  Number one, they are remodeling the lobby of the Seafarers and it sounded like the entire building was going to fall down.  Number two, the "seafarers" watching TV on the Mezzanine were on their second bottle of alcohol (gin for breakfast and whiskey for lunch) and were starting to creep everyone out.  Number three we though that this mornings snow might have traffic all backed up and we didn't want to be fretting our way through security, but as it turned out we got over here in no time at all.  Number five, we feared that there would be long lines at checkin and security due to flight changes and cancellations, which also proved to be a non-issue.  So, here we sit, two hours before boarding, the flight is on time so far...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning started out early, I was wide awake at 4AM, my mind on the trip home today.  We had to be out the door at 7AM to catch our train to Stamford Connecticut, where we visited NBC.  We had two great speakers today John Fritsche, and Bucky Gunt (Google him, he's won a ton of Emmys).  Unfortunately as we were on the train to Stamford some lovely white flakes of snow began to come out of the sky.  Sadly in New York even a few white flakes raise havoc with the schedules at Laguardia, Newark, and JFK.  On top of that tomorrow there is a winter storm watch out for our area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backing up to this morning again.  We got to the Union Square station where we were going to take any of the uptown bound trains to grand central station.  We told everyone, if the cars are crowded meet up on the platform  The cars were indeed crowded but after our london experience you would not believe how proficient our students have become at jamming themselves onto a subway.  So we all made it onto the train.  But not 30 seconds after we got off both Craig and I came up one student short.  I knew that student was on the train because I saw him and talked to him on the way to grand central.  But just like that he was gone!  Where did he go?  Did he fail to "mind the gap?"  Was he abducted by a band of roving gypsies?  Did a crazed herd of subway rats drag him away?  We had to move to the platform to catch our train to Stamford and unfortunately this student did not have his cell phone along.  So one stayed behind until the last possible minute to see if he returned, and the rest of us went on to catch our Stamford train.  Sadly, we had lost him.  Well, I knew that other than missing the NBC presentations he would be fine.  He could always go back to the hotel and meet us there later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were standing in the snow in Stamford he finally called.  He was at a pay-phone and was safe and sound.  He had gone up the stairs following someone in a coat that looked suspiciously like Craig's.  After following not-craig for a while he finally realized that he was following the wrong guy.  By then he didn't know how to get back to us and we were probably gone by then anyway.  We are all hopeful that this will be the final mass transit mishap of the trip!  -- A short update craig just surmised that our inbound plane is 20 minutes ahead of schedule.  So, the good news is that we have an inbound plane, it is in the air, and it is ahead of schedule.  Yea!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:30  Well, scratch that... Our plane is actually now going to arrive about 16 minutes late.  It took off late from Charlotte, so is behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:23 CST:  Finally off the plane, after landing only about a minute late we were informed by the captain that an AA 737 landed just 10 seconds ahead of us.  Unfortunately they only have one ground crew so we wait on the tarmac unable to pull into our gate.  Finally we pull into the gate but we wait another 10 minutes before someone finally moves the jet bridge into place.  I'm pretty sure that was Cat having her final revenge on me for publicly calling her out in an earlier post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, all is well that ends well.  Even though we waited a long time (25 minutes) to get off the plane, our luggage was waiting for us at baggage claim, so there was no additional wait there.  By 10PM Craig and I were in my car, yes my car, freedom, no reliance on public transportation, no waiting for cranky gate agents, we could just get in my car and drive the last 2:20 minutes to get home to Decorah.  We arrived just after midnight.  Sweet.  It was a great trip, but there's no place like home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we headed up to 30 rock to do the studio tour and visit Top of Rock.  The studio tour was fun.  We saw Dr. Oz's studio (who??) and the Jimmy Fallon set, also home to Johnny Carson's show when he was in New York.  Finally we saw the SNL set.  Lots of great memorabilia and great memories in looking at that set.  Unfortunately there is a no picture policy on the tour so nothing to share there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can share is this video clip.  Partway through the tour, our guides asked for a couple of volunteers to 'do some reading'  Craig and I both volunteered, and it turned out they were going to show us how a mini news broadcast goes together.  So, Craig is the anchorman, and I am the weather guy.  Its not as easy as it looks standing in front of the green screen, reading the teleprompter, and moving pointing at something nonexistent behind you.&lt;/p&gt;

 My room was warm, and the sheets were clean but the whole place is pretty worn and grimy looking.  And, there is just one kind of gross shower for each half of our floor.  But the quiet!!  The week in London at the "Royal National"  was not very royal but again the sheets and rooms were clean and I had my own nice clean bathroom.  By far the best of the trip was the hostel in Interlaken.  But I am so looking forward to getting home to my own bed and my own shower, and my own hot water and tea...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking for myself&lt;/strong&gt; -- Its been fun enjoying the local cuisines along the way.  Germany:  Schnitzel and Wurst and the beer at the Hofbrau house.  Switzerland: Interlaken more good german food but Lausanne was not so interesting.  Torino:  We had an awesome little meal at a neighborhood restaurant in Torino and some other good pasta options as well.  The challenge was finding restaurants that could accommodate all of us.  Most of them were pretty small so to fit the entire group we ended up using some cafeteria style places where everyone could work their way through.  London:  Good Indian, Chinese, and of course the fish and chips at the pubs was really good.  But, I'm ready to cook some of my favorites and just eat a little less!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Routine&lt;/strong&gt; -- I'm such a creature of habit.  I miss getting up in the morning and doing Kettlebells, I miss getting up and just going up to my office to quietly read the news and have a cup of tea.  On the road I have to shower and get dressed before I can go find someplace to sit, and read, and even then it is not quiet, its someplace like starbucks or some local coffee joint that is bustling with activity.  I end up not reading and people watching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing 500&lt;/strong&gt; -- Another great part of the rhythm of my life at home is gathering on the weekends to play cards with friends.  Around the table we catch up, discuss Decorah and National politics, parenting, and whatever.  Some nights are really intense, and some nights can be downright depressing if the cards are bad.  But nobody really remembers who won or lost a week later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decorah&lt;/strong&gt; -- Three weeks of being in big cities really reminds me of all the things I appreciate about our community.  I love going into a restaurant and knowing the staff, and knowing that while I eat my lunch I'm going to see people I know and have the chance to catch up with them.  I miss having my coffee at Java Johns were again I know the staff, and all of the interesting people that come in each morning.  I miss the smallness and familiarity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight home was a Godsend as well.  I went up to the desk to ask if I could change from a center to an aisle seat.  The lady said no problem, she moved me to row 31 and said that it was likely nobody else would be beside me.  So yes, I had a whole row to myself for the flight home.  As it turned out we all could have had our own rows as the back third of the plane was pretty much empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following all instructions we arrived at Heathrow three hours in advance of our flight, the Picadilly line was much more crowded that we expected it to be for 7:30 on a sunday morning.  But when we got to heathrow, there was no waiting at the continental desk to check in for our flight, and there was virtually no waiting in the security line either.  So, we had plenty of time to sit around the gate area and wait for our flight.  I think we all spent more time waiting to get through passport control at Newark than we did in the security line at Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just missed the 3:15 train to New York Penn Station, so we ended up having to wait there for the 4:04.  Every other hour of the day has an xx:28 train to Penn station except for 3pm.  Once we got into the city we had to get subway passes for everyone.  Unlike London, it is impossible in New York to use a credit card to by 26 unlimited passes.  So, we had to trudge to the Herald Square station and have everyone line up to use their own cards to get their subway passes for the two days here in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, about 4 hours after landing we made it to Seafarers.  It is midnight London time, but everyone was excited to eat some american food, and catch the end of the Packers, Bears game.  More american football was to come with the Steelers and the Jets.  Craig and I went to watch the end of the Packers game at TGI Fridays, and then headed out to Pete's Tavern.  It was great to have an American hamburger, with blue cheese!  I loved the fish and chips at all of the london pubs, but it was really nice to be back home.  Although we are still a 3 hour flight from Minneapolis I feel like we are close enough to home to reach out and touch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have a group  meeting at 9, then a speaker from NBC Olympics at 10.  Everyone is on their own for the day after our speaker, until we have our final group dinner tonight.  Tomorrow will be a busy day as we have a meeting in Connecticut, and then by mid afternoon the group will begin to disperse for the various flights back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't think of a better way to end a trip to London that with a Premier League Football match.  We were very fortunate to get group tickets to the Fulham versus Stoke City match this afternoon.  Fulham plays in a venue known as Craven Cottage.  Its a smaller, more …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2316.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTs3v8onh4I/AAAAAAAAALU/FtE05itJakg/IMG_2316.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2316.jpg" width="200" height="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't think of a better way to end a trip to London that with a Premier League Football match.  We were very fortunate to get group tickets to the Fulham versus Stoke City match this afternoon.  Fulham plays in a venue known as Craven Cottage.  Its a smaller, more intimate stadium, but we ended up with great seats.  We were in about the 24th row behind and to the keepers left of the goal.  A high hard kick over the crossbar would land right in my lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2324.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTs3tsRgiTI/AAAAAAAAALQ/Vp1f1ONprCY/IMG_2324.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2324.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fulham won the game handily 2 nil with Clint Dempsey scoring both goals for Fulham.  We thought, briefly, about a USA USA chant for Dempsey, but decided that might not be appreciated by all of the other football fans around us, so we just cheered loudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to an English Premier League match is a fun experience. We sat in the neutral zone of the stadium so we were not right in with the Fulham or the Stokes City fans.  So our section was a bit quieter than all the others.  We were the closest to the Stokes City visitors section and it was really a riot to listen to them sing, and chant, and carry on throughout the game.  They only quieted down about midway through the second half when it became very clear that there was no way they were going to win the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of Dads right behind me that had brought their two young boys to the game, so it was interesting to listen to them explain football to the boys, who already knew as much about the game as many of us.  It was a great experience and one that I will remember fondly for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days are really a blur.  We have had more great meetings and class discussions, and finally some time to explore the city on our own.  Quite honestly I'm 'museumed out' at the moment.  I've been to The British Museum, The London Transportation Museum, the Tate Modern, The London Docklands, The Imperial War Museum, and the British Library.  All were interesting in their own way, but you get museum, and information overload at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of the highlights for me were the Transportation Museum, seeing the development of the London Underground, beginning in the 1830s and moving forward is a pretty interesting study in engineering, and city planning.   The development of tunneling technologies, and the escalator were really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another highlight was seeing a letter from Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage at the British Library.  The library has labelled this letter as the first computer program, as she is explaining how to program the difference engine to solve a mathematical problem that had never been solved by hand before.  Also at the Library was Handel's original score for the Messiah!  You could see his notes as well as the names of the soloists that were performing the different parts.  They also have one of four copies of the Magna Carta on display.  This is a document written in 1215 or so, and is widely considered to be a model for our own constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we had our final group dinner in London, and the Imperial China restaurant.  We had our own room, with a Karaoke machine and a special menu.  Tons of food, and great fun was had singing karaoke by all.    Here you can see Paul, Joe, and Carl treating us to a country song.  We also had Rap, Glen Campbell, and even a couple of Disco numbers.  It is really strange to think that all of these students know the lyrics to every Backstreet boys song ever written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2305.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTs3zOSV8BI/AAAAAAAAALY/3W0K3rSBHeQ/IMG_2305.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2305.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is an early morning as we have to be on the Tube going to heathrow by 7:30.  We leave London at around 11:15am and arrive in New York at about 3:00pm.  We've all enjoyed our time in Europe, but we are also ready to be back in the states again.  I know that even after a proper football game this afternoon, a number of the students are hoping to make it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met up again at 4:00 at a place called the View Tube.  This is an educational facility that overlooks the Olympic stadium and Village area.  We met with an architect who is the project manager for the Olympic Village.  It was an absolutely fascinating meeting.  How do you design a village to house 10,000 athletes that will be turned into market housing as well as affordable housing once the games are over?  Furthermore how do you build all of this to the latest green standards?  How do you design a new city neighborhood, with safety and security as primary design constraints?  How do you move millions of people in and out of this neighborhood on a daily basis?  These are just some of the design goals for the Olympic Village and park area.  Here are a couple of pictures of the stadium and the aquatic center in construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2288.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTf3RUObaLI/AAAAAAAAALE/D1tjdgB9KQc/IMG_2288.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2288.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2289.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTf3S3TkGFI/AAAAAAAAALI/2TdTfSvpaS4/IMG_2289.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2289.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apartments that house the athletes during the games are all built without kitchens and other 'extra' rooms to provide extra bedroom space.  After the games the kitchens are added before they go on sale.  We also learned that all of these apartments are designed and built so that they do not need heating during the winter!  This is amazing to me, but we were further told that they didn't think they could sell them without heat, so in floor heating is added throughout.  The water for the in-floor heat comes from a central facility, so should it ever be needed it is extremely efficient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project really is amazing, the amount of social and civic engineering that has gone into the design of the village really boggles my mind.  Not only that but consider that much of this was designed, and even some construction was started before the economic crash in 2008.  The crash led to a full time out to re-evaluate and re-finance much of the operation.  Its just amazing that they are going to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our meeting at the View Tube, we all scattered for dinner on our own and then met up again at the Dominion Theater for We Will Rock You.  This is a musical where the plot and characters are loosely based around the Bohemian Rhapsody .  Lots of great Queen songs that we all wanted to sing along with.  Craig and I had our dinner at the Tottenham Pub, and I decided that I really needed to try a meat pie during my stay in London, so I had a chicken and mushroom pie for supper.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10:30 we gathered for a trip down to Wimbledon.  First on the agenda for the day was a walking tour of the stadium.  It was fantastic.  Everything you would expect from Wimbledon.  Of course at this time of year the place is pretty quiet except for the workers who are already at work preparing the stadium for the Championship at the end of June.  Much of this enormous complex is only used for a couple of weeks during the year.  There are courts that the members are allowed to use, but not the competition courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2264.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTbqrURzTqI/AAAAAAAAAK4/7xTUYCDEvV8/IMG_2264.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2264.jpg" width="450" height="147" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guide told us the story of how the week after the tournament, the process begins to prepare the courts for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dig up the current turf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put weed killer on the remaining bits of grass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove the top six inches of dirt to get rid of the weed killer and any remaining grass or (gasp) weeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace with fresh dirt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seed with rye grass&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The grass is then watered, mowed, and generally allowed to grow naturally until about April. Mostly naturally anyway, we saw that the had little heat lamps that moved slowly back and forth over the grass during the course of a week. You can see the lamps in the picture below.  In April the grounds keepers begin mowing the grass shorter and shorter.  By competition time the grass is down to just 6 millimeters in length.  The cutting must be done very gradually or the grass will go into shock, and you know thats not good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2285.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTbqutSMPYI/AAAAAAAAAK8/u7tT2UctGWY/IMG_2285.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2285.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;Finally, testing begins.  A person comes in and literally counts the blades of grass per square meter to make sure the turf is the right density, and that the tennis ball will bounce to the correct height. when dropped from a test machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got to go in the press room, and sit in the chairs where the players come every day to give their interviews.  It was fun to sit in the same chair as Nadal, Federer, and MacEnroe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were allowed to sit in the stands on court 1 as well as Centre Court, so we got a good idea of how intimate the Wimbledon stadiums are and what it would be like to actually attend a match.  After the stadium tour we had a marketing presentation and learned a little about the way they market the stadium and the museum during the other 50 weeks of the year.  All in all it was an impressive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Bromley by Bow, we did a quick count and realized we had a little more than half of our group.  When the next train pulled in we looked for the rest of the group, but not a single student got off the train.  Soon another train pulled in and I noticed that this was a district line train so I didn't expect any students to get off.  Well, train after train came into the station but they were all district line trains.  That voice in the back of my head told me 'somethings not right'  so I went up to the ticket office to inquire when the next Hammersmith and City train was expected.  "Service is suspended." he told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Till when?"  I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"indefinitely." I was told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crap!  Why didn't I listen to that voice that told me to jump off the train?  Time to regroup.  Craig and I decided that he would take the students that were here on the tour and I would wait at the station.  We knew that within the group there was the intelligence to figure out a way to get down to the district line and out here eventually.  I would meet them and call craig and we would figure out how to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Craig and the guide and the group took off in the rain on the tour and I hung out in the station.  Pretty soon I noticed that there were not any district line trains coming in any more.  So, back to the information desk.  Yep, District line service is also suspended due to signaling problems at Bow Road station.  Well, that does it, I had already waited around the station for 40 minutes so there was no way they were going to make it now and even if they did the tour would be finishing up.  So I hopped on the next train heading back in.  As I passed each station, I scanned the faces on the platform on the other side.  If I saw the group I could hop off and catch up with them.  But they were no where to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about an hour to get back to Russell square and our hotel and when I walked in a group of the cheerfully greeted me in the lobby.  "We tried to catch up with you but all the lines were suspended."  They had their own odyssey of planes and busses and walking in the rain that you can read about on the class blog.  (olympicsjterm11.blogspot.com).  They had tried their best using all of their ingenuity to catch up with us, but it just was not to be.  They were all safe, and sound and much the better for having to learn how to navigate the London Tube system on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have been following this blog you may be wondering how on earth I came to be allowed to lead students abroad.  Torn ligaments, separated shoulders, leaving students behind on busses and trains.  Is there any defense for all that?  Nope, these are ingenious  Luther students, in every case they knew where they had to be and how to get there.  In my mind this is part of the experience of learning how to navigate your way around a foreign country.  We're having a blast and we'll make sure we get everyone home in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are off to Wimbledon, and looking forward to our meetings and tour there.  But, if I do hear that voice telling me to jump off the train to stay with the group, I think I'll listen to it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When craig proposed the course, and we talked about Torino, we  both thought of Stefano.  I contacted him via email, and he immediately responded that he would be happy to help.  Stefano organized a very nice morning for us.  He stopped at our hotel to walk with us to the Foundacion Alberto Collonetti, where some of his friends were gathered.  The friends had all been involved in the Olympics in some way as volunteers, and they told told us a bit about what they had done, and what the Olympics had meant to Torino.  Although some of the venues have very quickly decayed and are going unused, everyone agreed that the Olympics had a big economic and cultural impact on the city.  Before the olympics Torino was probably only known as the home of the shroud, and was not really a tourist destination, but since the olympics Torino has become a tourist destination for people from throughout the world.  In addition the olympics had a big impact on the character of the people, according to many that we spoke with, prior to the olympics people in Torino were not very welcoming of strangers, but since then the city has learned to be more friendly and open.  We saw this to some degree, but in general we found it was difficult to find someone that could speak english.  This was such a different experience than I have had traveling in other cities in Italy.  After the presentations were over they answered the students questions for quite a while.  We were happy to use some of our honoraria money to make a small donation to the Foundacion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stefano and his friend Fabrizio helped us the rest of the day by accompanying us to the Olympic Village, to lunch, and even to our second meeting of the day with Delatre.  For lunch we walked through the abandoned village and over to a rehabilitated Fiat factory.  The factory has been turned into a mall, and office building.  Across the street from the end of the mall is a place called Eataly, which is a very nice high end grocery store (more on this later) that also has a cafeteria.  We bought Stefano and Fabrizio lunch, and it was nice to have Stefano translate the menu for us. We had a very nice glass of Prosecco naturale, not the champagne version but the still version.  Craig and I each had a plate of pasta with meat sauce (veal) while the others had pasta and mussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of bus rides later and we were at Delatre.  This is a technology company that does a lot of web work for NBC, the BBC, and CTV.  Their big thing is tying together the video stream with all the meta data about the players and the scores.  For broadcasters they basically provide everything you would need to know to do color commentary on a game.  They license some cool technology that tracks each football player on the pitch, as well as the ball and the referees.  The software can detect when one player passes to another, and provides real time statistics.  You can access this on the website, like nbcolympics.com,  or they have a special product just for broadcasters to use.  It was a very interesting presentation, especially for the 3 computer scientists in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the presentation they allowed craig to stay behind to print out our boarding passes.  I took the rest of the group down the road to the grocery store.  The original idea was to wait for craig, but we soon gave up on that and began walking back to the hotel on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew that to get back to the hotel we just had to walk east until we found Corso Re Umberto.  At that point we would go north to our hotel.  I knew it was a long way, so once we reached Re Umberto I said I would run across the road and see if the bus went all the way up to our hotel.  Unfortunately as I was asking the bus driver this question, he just started driving away.  I tried to wave to the confused looking students on the other side of the road, who were staring at the place the bus used to be as if I had somehow vanished into thin air.  I did manage to make eye contact with one or two so they knew I was on the bus and they soon followed.  Meanwhile back at the hotel we waited and waited for craig.  Finally I decided not to wait any longer and just go ahead with our group discussion.  When craig finally returned we had our first glimpse of what flying Ryanair was going to be like.  To print out our online boarding passes he had to enter, name, birthday, passport number, expiration date, flight information for every member of our group before he could print out the passes!  Of course this took forever, especially since on the first try he entered all of the information only to be told that the session had time out.  This meant he had to enter it all over again, but in smaller batches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the group discussion we walked down the block to ottoe tre quarte (8 3/4) where we had a glass of wine and some Calzone.  After dinner we were both exhausted so we just went back to the hotel to get some sleep.  Lest you think I was in bed by 7, you should know that supper time in this part of italy doesn't start until 8:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been warned well in advance about all the extra fees that Ryanair charges, so everyone was very careful to make sure their bags were under the 20 kg limit.  The ticketing agent was very friendly and even let a couple of the bags that were slightly over the limit slide through.  After checking bags it was all the way to the back of the line, which stretched all the way across the terminal.  Luckily the line moved along much more quickly that we were used to so we got through security in about 45 minutes.  After security we had to go through passport control. and then get in line.  There are no assigned seats on Ryanair so this is where things get downright pushy.  Everyone was trying to crowd the front of the line.  When they finally announced that our flight was going to be delayed due to the heavy fog.  The delay did not deter anyone from camping out at the front of the line, which is really funny because when we finally got through the boarding line we did not get on the plane!  Instead we had to walk down a bunch of stairs and board a bus, where we waited for another 20 minutes!  Finally the busses closed their doors and were ready to take off.  We almost had a mutiny on our bus when it appeared as though the second bus, with those slackers who were at the back of the line was going to leave for the plane before all of us who had been near the front!  Horrors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the busses arrived at the plane, ours stopped near the front door, but the other bus went around to the back.  It looked like those sluggards were going to catch a break after all.  Luckily for me craig was lucky enough to be right be the door at the back.  He headed straight on and to the middle of the plane to reserve an exit row so that Aaron could stretch out his legs.  As it turned out Aaron could not sit in the exit row because of his crutches, so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2250.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTP1mMpc0GI/AAAAAAAAAKs/eoi2rZ-i36w/IMG_2250.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2250.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took off in heavy fog, but it only took a few seconds to get above it all where we were treated to beautiful views of the mountains surrounding Torino.  The captain says the weather in London is clear and sunny so we are all excited to get to see the sun, and to spend some time in an English speaking country!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Do you know where we can find a corkscrew?"  I was asked.  Being a leader makes me the font of all knowledge of course, so I must know.  "Well..." I said, "I have a corkscrew on my swiss army knife."  "Great!  can you open this for me?"  Why not, I thought... Somehow the idea of me opening a bottle of wine for a student wasn't anywhere on my list of duties as a faculty member, and I'm not sure its one that the administration would want to cultivate, but here we are in Italy, I might as well be helpful.  So, I cut the foil and pop one cork.  Its as if the sound of that cork sliding out of the bottle was like some kind of whistle.  The next thing I know I'm surrounded by students holding bottles of wine.  One or two of them decided it would be a great idea to take a picture of me opening wine bottles.  I think the picture below really captures the moment.  You can see Craig laughing in the background as if to say,  "ha ha, there goes Brad's career."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="CIMG7035.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTIVM2vBfGI/AAAAAAAAAKI/Ls16QIDb3EI/CIMG7035.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="CIMG7035.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus began our first night in Torino.  It was another long train trip from Lausanne to Torino, made a bit more exciting by the fact that just after we crossed the border into Italy the train got behind schedule.  What had been a 40 minute layover in Milano Centrale turned into a 10 minute dash from one train to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got to Torino, we had lunch, our first at McDonalds since the trip began, because we knew we were too early to check into our hotel.  I had a McBacon and fries.  It tasted quite good.  The Hotel Artua Solferino is a nice old European hotel.  Each room is very different.  My room is up the stairs at the end of the hall, and has the smallest bathroom in Italy.  Right over my shower is a skylight that leaks cold air like crazy.  This morning as I tried to take a shower, I could not get hot water and so the combination of the cool breeze and the luke warm shower water (with approximately zero pressure) was pretty pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After orienting the students to the area, we turned them loose to see what they could find for dinner.  Craig and I waited a while and then took off for the city centro.  We walked around and investigated a lot of restaurants.  We looked for some that might be able to accommodate our entire group, and some that looked like they might be nice for us.  We ended up finding a great little neighborhood restaurante.  Not a tourist place at all, and not pretentious.  They had a three course chefs menu that looked great.  I had awesome risotto, a green salad, and delicious veal arrosto.  The meal came with 3 dl of wine which was perfecto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With dinner done, we made our way back to the hotel.  Its amazing how tired I get each day, worrying about the 24 welfare of 24 students traveling in a foreign country where none of us really speak the language well is very tiring.  This seems to be especially true here in Torino.  Although we have heard that the city has made great strides in welcoming tourists, we find that there are not all that many people that really speak English.  Despite that , it is a good beginning to Torino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit to the Olympic museum was good.  They have some cool interactive exhibits where you can test your reflexes, train at altitude, and have a look at all of the new technologies that athletes and their coaches are using.  My favorite was the basketball tracker.  A camera on each corner of the court records the movements of players, a computer is then able to use that information to triangulate the exact position of each player on the court at all times.  Coaches are now using this to do a statistical analysis of how players are likely to respond to different offensive or defensive strategies.  Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finished our tour, the mist had lifted a bit so we could actually see the mountains peeking up over the low clouds.  I think that is Mont Blanc on the right of the picture below.  It may be a little hard to tell, but there is actually a layer of low clouds right at the top of the flag poles in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2162.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TS4Jt5fbsDI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/aP7isLCfTt0/IMG_2162.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2162.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the museum tour, everyone was on their own for lunch.  Craig and I checked out the Manora, which is a nice, reasonably priced buffet near St. Francis.    After lunch I walked around a bit, and bought a new converter to replace the one I left in the outlet in Interlaken.  We had a hike planned to a tower on the highest point in town for 3:00 in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it was raining a bit at 3, and the clouds had returned but we decided to give it a try anyway.  After a very long walk up hill we found this spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2183.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TS4JvO1mm7I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/fzi44vwwDXE/IMG_2183.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2183.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which wasn't a tower, but there was a flag pole we could climb.  As you can see there is not much scenery behind the students as we were up into the clouds. and it was hard to see the lake much less any of the mountains from where we were.  Nonetheless Craig was determined to find the tower that we set off for, and so while the rest of us were fooling around and looking at the small plastic bag with the odd botanical stencil on it he was trying to find the tower.  And, after another half mile of walking up hill here it was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2184.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TS4JwQKxPbI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/degYXGozwvs/IMG_2184.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2184.jpg" width="400" height="533" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could not even see the top of the tower when you were standing right in front of it.  However, we had come this far and were determined to reach the peak.  So we climbed the 151 stairs to the top of the tower.  And we were barely treated to a view of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2194.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TS4Jxz_zO1I/AAAAAAAAAKA/AqKUjSQGmEk/IMG_2194.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2194.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see we were definitely in the clouds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk back to the hostel was all downhill and definitely an easier walk.  We found a nice french bistro to stop for a happy hour drink, and enjoyed the rest.  After we got back to the Hostel and caught up with the rest of the students, Craig and I found a very nice Asian restaurant (Asian Garden) for our supper.  Back to the room and to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a great group of students and its fun to see them come together as they get to know each other better.  They rely less on us and more on each other with each passing day of the trip, and thats a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the ski slopes from Interlaken requires a bus ride, to Winderwil, followed by a train ride to Lauterbrunn, followed by a different train ride to Wengen, followed by a trip up the Mannlichen Gondola.  Unfortunately after all that trouble the quality of the snow was pretty bad.  The weather here in Interlaken the past couple of days has been unseasonably warm, so the snow is really icy in the morning, turning to slush by mid-day.  Most of the students that followed me out the door of our Hostel (Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof) were beginners.  By the end of the day they were calling themselves the Blue Crew because they were only taking the blue runs.  Note to U.S. skiiers, in the Alps blue is easy, red is intermediate, while black is for experts.  Somehow I got separated from the group right away and ended up doing the first run by myself.  It turned out that they had all skiied a ways ahead of mebut had stopped to contemplate their options in terms of which run to take.  Even after that contemplation they ended up taking a red run, which was not what they wanted to do.  It was during this first run that Aaron took a spill, and tore the ACL, and MCL ligaments in his knee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I waited at the bottom and top of the lift hoping to find the group again I was unsuccessful for several runs.  Maybe an hours worth of skiing.  Finally I did see the group coming off the blue run and the first thing I heard was "have you seen Aaron?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I said, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He fell and hurt himself on the run.  He told us to go on to the bottom but now we're too scared to ski back down to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I took my board down the run and found him sitting all by himself by the side of a snow making machine.  Only one person had stopped to see if he needed help, and due to the language barrier apparently determined he was fine.  Meanwhile, I had talked to a couple of ski instructors and managed to locate a ski patrol on a snowmobile.  He joined us on the slope and made the assessment that Aaron was going to need to go to Wengen for some X-Rays.  As we were waiting we decided that we needed a better cover story than falling during the first run of the day.  Hence the Lindsey Vonn reference.  Our story is that she was on the slopes practicing for the world cup race next week and decided to flirt with Aaron, this distracted him momentarily and caused him to crash.  Sadly she did not stop to help or he would probably feel just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After wrapping Aaron up like a Papoose on the sled behind the snowmobile the patrol took off for the Gondola, and I was supposed to ski down and take the lift back up and meet them there.  By the time I arrived the Gondola had already taken Aaron down, so I had to wait for the next one.  Down in Wengen Aaron got a ride in a taxi to the doctor's office and was awaiting an X-ray by the time I arrived.  It only took about an hour and a half at the doctors office to get the X-Ray with the preliminary diagnosis of a torn crucial ligament.  They scheduled a followup appointment the next day so the other doctor could read the X-ray and weigh in.  They outfitted Aaron with a pair of crutches that included flip down spikes for the bottom to aid in navigating through the snow, and we were off.  Aaron with one ski boot on and his crutches, me carrying the other ski boot, his poles, helmet, skiis, and my own board, it was kind of a sad sight to see us slowly trudging through the narrow streets of Wengen back to the Bahnhoff.  Remember all the train and bus stops it took to get to Wengen?  Well we had to do the whole process in reverse loading and offloading skis, boards, etc. at each change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron and I made it back to the Hostel, where we began the process of calling our travel insurance company, Luther Study Abroad folks, and Aaron's parents.  As I write this we are in "insurance-limbo" waiting to hear from our company whether they will cover an MRI in Laussane.  The MRI is critical because it appears that in addition to the torn ligaments there is also a small bone chip.  If the chip is too large or in the wrong place then He'll have to go home and get ready for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2141.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSsHTNjjFAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/Vzrxuo8D30c/IMG_2141.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2141.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we left the hostel this morning we had another casualty.  Josh was zipping up his suitcase in the lobby and it exploded, just like in the movies.  The zipper is shot.  So, the helpful woman at the front desk provided us with some packing tape!  Jeff and I held the suitcase while josh wrapped it about 8 times around with the packing tape.  This will get him from Interlaken to Lausanne, although I did pick up one sock that fell out along the way.  Luckily I saw Josh washing clothes last night so I was pretty sure it was a clean one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, here's an update on skiing etc.  I turned in my snowboard for a pair of skis and boots.  As a result, yesterday was extremely enjoyable.  I skied with Craig, Nick, Jessica, and Camille.  Mostly the red runs all day long.  Even though I haven't been on skis for a few years it came back right away.  The views were spectacular, although the runs were still pretty icy in many places.  I felt much more confident on the skis than I did on the snowboard and so was able to enjoy the day much more.  We took the train all the way to Kleine Scheidegg which is the highest point the train goes that serves the ski villages and lifts.  We were able to get several runs in on each of the three lifts that start in the Kleine Scheidegg area.  We skiid the Lauberhorn run which goes all the way down to Grindelwald, then took the small trams back to Mannlichen and worked our way over lift by lift to get back to Kleine Scheidegg.  We were very hungry by this time so we had lunch and then skied down to Grindelwald train station and declared victory.  Much fun, and no injuries in the group!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2132.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSsHVDMW46I/AAAAAAAAAJc/yEzY0gYHwRo/IMG_2132.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2132.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, back at the Hostel, as I was coming up to check my email Matt asked me "Where is the hospital?"  Oh good God I thought to myself.  Yes, we have another injury.  It turned out that Nody separated his shoulder.  At least this one is not a going-home kind of injury and won't really slow him down.  The only thing will be that someone will have to carry his backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now we need a luggage porter for Aaron, and a backpack carrier for Eric.  We are very thankful that the skiing portion of the trip is over.  Just now one of the students said, hey lets try ski jumping when we're in Lausanne!   I think its time to nix that idea before it catches on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many other great exhibits, the aeronautical area had a cross section of an Airbus A320 and several other interesting aircraft, there was a really amazing mining exhibit as well.  The nautical area was equally amazing with replicas of ships both large and small.  You could easily spend a whole day at the museum, but my mind was pretty overloaded by 11:30.  The plan was to head back to the Viktalien Markt for a street lunch of sausage and bread, unfortunately everything was closed, it turns out that Epiphany is a national holiday in Germany, so we really had to work to find a street vendor that was open.  I had to try the Currywurst, which was a sausage in a sweet sauce with curry powder sprinkled over the top.  It was a delicious German meets Indian fusion street food kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With lunch behind us we met up with the rest of the group to head back to the airport to meet with Sebastian, a marketing guy, from Lufthansa.  He gave us a great presentation on Lufthansa and their support of the Munich 2018 bid.  The Lufthansa folks had very generously provided us all with Munich 2018 stocking hats and scarves.  After the meeting we took a group photo with everyone wearing their new gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Group 2.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSc98Q_VcqI/AAAAAAAAAJI/KltztXDDBK4/Group%202.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Group 2.jpg" width="400" height="300" /&gt;After the Lufthansa meeting we returned to the Hostel for some group discussion and to get ready for our dinner at the Hofbrauhaus!  We were not in the main hall, but were upstairs in their groupdining area.  I had a fantastic dinner of veal ragout with Spaetzel, and a good size dark beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner was pretty calm until a huge group of Canadiens came it.  It was a group of ninth grade hockey players and their parents.  Things really started to heat up when the parents started singing Canadian drinking songs and chugging their beers.  This brought on a resounding L-U, L-U, L-U-T-H, T-H, T-H, T-H-E-R from the Luther crowd and soon we were all friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at my room, sleep was hard to come by in this second night.  I mostly drifted in and out of sleep until my alarm went off at 6AM, we needed to be out of the hostel and headed for the train station by 6:45.  As I write this I am on the train to Mannheim and then Interlaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its been a long day, and a number of titles for this blog entry have crossed my mind. "Hurry up and wait" was the first title that occurred to me as we arrived at the airport at 5:00AM.  The lines to check our bags with American Airlines and get through security were as long as any as I've seen at the Minneapolis airport.  We finally made it through security with just enough time to run down the concourse.  As I arrived at the gate I warned the agent that there were several students in our group that were still behind me.  Cat's rather terse response was "well they have four minutes until I close the door."  Cat was well on her way to becoming my favorite person.  Four minutes came and went, and soon all the students were on board.  However the door remained open, and Cat continued to chat with the captain.  After a standard maddeningly long airport style delay the captain finally came on the intercom and told us that there was an indicator light on that was bad enough to keep us on the ground.  He had tried everything except on "last ditch effort" to clear the problem.  The captain continued to describe the vehicle that was going to carry us some 30,000 feet in the air over thousands of miles as "a machine somewhere between a video game and a personal computer"  So, what do you do when your PC is acting up?  Reboot.  Yes, the captain was going to reboot the airplane in hopes that the problem would magically go away.  The air went off, and the lights went out, and after a few minutes of darkness everything game back to life.  Unfortunately for us the indicator was still on.  So the captain announced we would have to get off the plane so that maintenance could come on board and try to fix the problem.   One of our students forgot his jacket on board the plane so after we were all off he went back aboard to retrieve the jacket.  As he was coming back on board the captain was heard to say "I don't know what the hell is wrong with this plane."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Craig and I tried to explain to Cat, the friendly agent, that it was very important for us to get to Laguardia in fairly good time as we had to make a transfer to Newark to make our flight to Munich.  Her helpful response was "why didn't you just fly to Newark in the first place?"  In the end she did say that if the flight was cancelled she could rebook us on a flight through Chicago directly into Newark.  So, I collected bag tags from everyone in case they needed to retrieve our luggage and transfer it to the plane that would be right next door.  The board was showing a 7:30 departure time for our flight, but when 7:15 came around there was no sign of Cat or any update on status.  Finally she came out and announced that we all must board immediately.  Of course one of the students had just left to use the restroom and this caused poor Cat no end of frustration.  Why would they leave the gate area!? she inquired rather crossly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end all were on board and the flight made it to Laguardia in plenty of time. All the luggage made it as well and so we collected the luggage and made our way to the ground transportation.  We boarded a bus that was supposed to take us directly to Penn station in Midtown where we were going to take a New Jersey rail train to the Newark airport.  However when we got to Grand Central we were told that we needed to transfer to one of the small vans. Unfortunately all 16 of our group would not fit in one van.  After some work a second van came and we got aboard, with a couple of students needing to sit on the floor!  Our driver insisted that we needed to be dropped off on the far side of penn station by the Amtrack lounge even though I repeatedly told him that we needed New Jersey rail.  Once again everything turned out fine and we made our way to Newark, found the group checkin desk and then dispersed for some much needed food. At this point it was about 2:30PM EST and we had not had anything to eat yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group met back at the gate area for our flight to Munich where we had our first group discussion on the first reading assignment right there.  The students had all done their readings and so the discussion was good.  Boarding for our flight to Munich went smoothly until I discovered that I had a middle middle seat.  Bummer, except that there was an open aisle with an open window right across the way.  I moved into the seat, hoping that nobody would kick me out, and luck was with me.  After a glass of wine and a short movie I was actually able to get in a short nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On we go... landing, baggage claim, and our trek to the airport train station in Munich all went off without a hitch.  At this point it was 7:30AM Munich time, or just after midnight CST the group was starting to show some signs of getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our train ride was about 40 minutes to get to the Hackerbruke station and then it was about a 4 block walk to our Hostel where we were not able to check in yet, but could at least store our luggage before we went out for a long walk around the city.  Craig was an excellent tour guide for our walking tour around Karlsplatz and Marienplatz.  Lunch was a rather expensive stop at the Ratskeller.  I had Weinerschnitzl and fries for 22 euro.  After lunch we took the train to the Olympic Park, where we had a 2:00 tour scheduled, so at this point we are all coming up on the mark where we have been awake for 24 hours.  Our tour guide had us watch a short video on the Olympic park and that is when the head bobbing seriously started.  People were dropping like flies, myself included.  Even after the video as we were standing, yes standing, and looking at a model of the park I found that my chin was suddenly on my chest!  Once we got out and started walking around the park people began to catch a second wind, and the enthusiasm of Ruth, our guide, began to catch on.  Its amazing how much use the Munich Olympic park gets, it is really a model of how to sustainably host the olympics.  Nearly every building is in use today for something, including the famous stadium which up until this year was still used for Bayern Munich soccer club.  They have since moved to the new Allianz stadium, but the stadium continues to be used for concerts and other large events.  We were able to go right now on the field and enjoy the view of the stadium and imagine that we were walking where famous olympians and football stars had also walked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tour was over, we went up to the top of the Olympic tower where we were treated to a fantastic view of the city, and the Alps in the distance.  With the tour over, people started to get tired again as we took the train back to our Hostel where we were able to check in to our rooms and then get ready to go to dinner.  We kept pushing to keep people awake until a reasonably late hour.  Craig, Aaron, and I went back to Marienplatz to the Andechs Am Dom a brewery where the beer is (or was) brewed by Monks.  I had a delicious dinner of roast pork and huge dumplings.  I'm pretty sure these are very similar the dumplings that I tried to make for Cenek, our Czech foreign exchange student a couple of years ago.  Its nice to finally see and taste how they are supposed to turn out.  Most of the group went to the Augustiner pub across the road from the hostel, so we stopped there on our way back to the Hostel to join them for another beer before turning in for the night.  This brings me up to date.  The trip is off to a good start but I need sleep badly.&lt;/p&gt;

Tomorrow is a day of travel back to Dublin and then we wake up and head to the airport to see Kaia off to France and the rest of us to Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our rain soaked day yesterday we were thrilled to wake up to see the sun and big puffy white clouds today. What a difference the sun makes!  Our departure this morning was slightly delayed as we were still drying shoes and clothing from yesterday, and (I suspect) because most of the group was in Roundstone partying at the pub until late last night.  The Miller family stayed and had dinner at the castle last night as we are all showing the wear of nearly four weeks on the road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't imagine what the maid must have though when she came into our room this morning.  I had been sitting on the floor drying 3 pairs of shoes with the blow drier; the shoes I've worn every day for the last 3 weeks, Josh's tennis shoes, and Jane's walking shoes.  The smell was indescribable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we did take off we headed out toward Roundstone, a beautiful little seaside village which is becoming very popular among the well to do here in Ireland.  When you come into town you go right past the house of the guy who wrote the original River Dance. From Roundstone we made our way along the coast toward Ballyconeely where we had our first 'table stop' of the day. Padraic was busy setting out a table with fruit and granola bars and juice for us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1061.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1061.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We only had a little further to go to get to Clifden, so we decided to do the Sky Drive loop before lunch rather than after.  That turned out to be a great decision as the weather cooperated perfectly and we were treated to magnificent views of the sea.  Based on the color of the sea you would think that you were in the Caribbean not Ireland!  As you might guess the Sky drive was a bit of a climb but it takes you right out to a point where you can see ocean in three different directions. Here's the Miller family at our stop on the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1062.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1062.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course by this time our guides had already schemed to set up another table stop.  They had gone to the store in Clifden and bought some more Bulmers cider, this was the new berry flavor that Padraic had not had before so he was even more excited than usual for us to give it a try.  We toasted a great trip and all of our new found friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ride back into Clifden was mostly downhill, but by this time we really were ready for some food.  We ate at E.J. Kings pub, Jane and I had the chicken curry, Kaia had ravioli, and Josh had a club sandwich.  I think Padraic was a little disappointed that we had strayed from traditional irish fare but by this time our palate's were ready for something a little more spicy.  We all had to laugh at Josh during lunch because we were talking about the weather and how lucky we were that it wasn't raining like it was yesterday.  I said yes, it only rains in Ireland on days that contain a 'y.'  Jane and Kaia laughed and the conversation moved on.  Suddenly, from out of the blue, Josh says, "wait every day has a 'y' in it."  We still love him.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we finished lunch it was almost 3:00 and it was time to head back to the Castle.  The Miller family took off a little ahead of the pack, and then Josh and I separated from Jane and Kaia, we made it back in record time.  It was our flattest ride yet.  The interesting thing about riding through the bog is how similar it looks to the prairies of Southern Minnesota, except where the glaciers flattened all the granite in Minnesota there were no glaciers here so the granite still stands in small hills and big chunks of rock sticking up out of the landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh and I were so fast  that I missed the last table stop.  A little bit of Jameson Irish Whiskey to toast our final ride.  Not being a whiskey fan, that did not hurt my feelings except that Padraic insisted on pouring me a glass in the parking lot of the Castle when he caught up to us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1063.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1063.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we have our final group meal in the main dining room here at the castle.  Based on the look I had at the menu last night it will be a feast.  This has really been a great way to finish up our vacation.  The people in our group have been a lot of fun, and DuVine really lives up to their motto, Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep.  In the photo above we have in the front row, Dan, Craig, Kaia, Laurie, and Joanna.  In the back row we have Patty (Dan's wife) Bobby and Brian, Brad and Jane, Josh, and James (Joanna's fiance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not in the picture are our two amazing guides for the week Padraic and Kirk.  These guys are amazing and made for a really fun week.  Its easy to forget that every time we were having fun and sitting around enjoying ourselves they were tending to every minute detail to make sure that our trip was a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ballynahinch%20Castle&amp;z=10'&gt;Ballynahinch Castle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8969336433699357685?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>now i know why ireland is so green</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/now-i-know-why-ireland-is-so-green.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-07-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-07-01:/PelicanBlog/now-i-know-why-ireland-is-so-green.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...

This morning the sky was mostly cloudy, and there was almost no wind.  So I went along with Dan, Brian, James, and Joanna to do the mast ride.  This was an optional 8 mile ride for the before breakfast crowd.  The main feature of this ride was an 840 (Padraic said 250, but the GPS showed the lie) foot climb.  Most of that 840 feet was in the last 3/4 of a mile.  For those of you from Decorah just imagine the First Lutheran hill extended to 3/4 of a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view from the mast was fantastic, we could see the ocean and a couple of beautiful lakes.  The hill was so steep, and the roads were just a little bit damp, that I actually had to walk my bike the last 100 yards, because I could not get enough traction when I was sitting on the bike and pedaling!  The ride down was almost as exciting, in fact it seemed quite a bit more dangerous than the ride up as it was difficult to keep your speed down without skidding all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/64.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_64.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing that ride I was very ready for my breakfast back at Rosleague Manor.  I had a ham and cheese omelet with some of the best croissants ever.  To wash down the omelet I had a glass of grapefruit juice and a cup of black coffee.  The manor employs a great French chef, and they have an exchange program to bring over young people from france to learn Irish service customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/65.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_65.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breakfast there was another optional ride.  From Rosleague we rode to Letterfrack, then out on the Connemara loop, past Molly the pirate queen's castle, and then on to Renvyle, Tulley, Tulley Cross, and then back to Letterfrack by a different road.  Once again we had fantastic views, we saw a small vertical wind turbine, and learned about Grace O'Malley the pirate queen.  Back in the 1500's she was a very powerful woman who enjoyed plundering the english royal ships that were in turn plundering all of Ireland.  She and queen Elizabeth met to try and resolve the issue but as long as Elizabeth was unwilling to stop plundering Ireland, Grace O'Malley was unwilling to stop sinking and plundering their ships.  Apparently they ended up agreeing to disagree, but I'm sure it was an exciting meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/66.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_66.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met up with the rest of the group in Letterfrack for lunch at Currachs.  Although three courses were offered as part of lunch most of us could not imagine eating more than one course and maybe a bit of dessert.  Many of us had the Irish pizza and it was quite good.  A nice change from the last couple of days.  I also had a chocolate chip cookie for desert which was excellent but a bad choice as the chocolate muffin was clearly superior.  Kaia had snicker bar pie which would have been a close second or third I'm sure.  Jane and Josh had apple pie and ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's where the story of the day takes a turn for the worse.  Just as we were finishing up, the weather forecast for the day came true.  Rain after noon.  We rode to the Kylmore Abbey in a torrential rain.  At one point we came out from behind a wind break and I was nearly stopped in my tracks by the strength of the wind.  My little water resistant biking wind breaker was doing nothing to stop this rain and I was wet and chilled by the time we got to the Abbey.  The Abbey was pretty impressive in the oppressive weather, and I'm sure it would have been brilliant in good weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Abbey I seriously considered buying a new waterproof winter coat, but instead I borrowed one of Padriac's extra rain jackets.  We had 17 additional miles to get to Ballynahinch (pronounced like bal-in-the-hinch if you say it really fast) Castle.  After a half a mile we were all soaked through completely, my shoes were completely soaked, my pants were soaked, all of my layers were soaked.  And the headwind was horrific.  After a while we realized that there was no possible way we could get any wetter, so we might just as well accept our fate and enjoy the ride.  Once again, I'm sure that in reasonable weather it would have been beautiful.  As it was I was still nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/67.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_67.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we are at the castle, showered, dried, and warm.  Our clothes have been sent off to be dried, and the porter will collect our shoes to leave them in the boiler room to dry over night.  All is well, as DuVine takes good care of us.  Our only remaining decision for the day is whether to stay here at the castle and eat at the pub or to go into town and try one of the restaurants there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ballynahinch%20castle&amp;z=10'&gt;Ballynahinch castle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8838488372752005579?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>an even better day in connemara</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/an-even-better-day-in-connemara.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-29:/PelicanBlog/an-even-better-day-in-connemara.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We woke up this morning in Ashford Castle to a clear blue sky.

After a breakfast, we were left our luggage outside our door and loaded our backpacks into the van.  We were on our way for 40 miles of cycling at 9:00 this morning.  We only rode about a half a mile before we made our first stop at the Ashford Abbey.  This is a very well preserved Abbey.  We learned that the most well preserved churches are from the church of Ireland, since in times past there were many interesting rules applied to the catholics.  For example if you were catholic you could only build your church out of wood.  If you were catholic you could not pass down your family land to one member of the family it had to be divided equally among all of the family members.  So for a large catholic family it did not take many generations before the land was subdivided into sections so small that they were useless for farming.  While we were at the Abbey reading gravestones,  I did discover a typo on one from the 1800's  the stone read that the couple buried was survived by "there" daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1060.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1060.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biking with DuVine is a bit different from the way I bike at home.  When I bike at home I just ride and I keep riding until I'm done.  With DuVine we ride, then we stop for snacks.  These snacks always involve an important local beverage.  We've tried some delicious Irish Stouts, a Smithwicks Ale, along with a some wonderful Bulmers Cider.   Anyway, as I was saying, the weather today was fantastic, no wind, and some great sun.  Here's a picture of Loch Fuehy (lake phooey) You could really see the reflection of the hills in the water it was so still.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1061.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1061.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first snack stop today was at the edge of Irelands only Fjord.  Does anyone know what it takes for a body of water to be a fjord?  Mike keep your hand down, anyone else?  No, well to be a fjord, you must be fed by the Ocean, and must be formed by a glacier.  For our stop we had some Bulmers pear cider (I hope someone in Decorah can get this) and some fruit.  After a little rest we continued up the road to our lunch stop.  We had a specially designed menu just for us.  I had some seafood chowder, a crab sandwich (right fresh from the fjord) and some Creme Brule for desert.  Below you can see a picture of the fjord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1062.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1062.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had one pretty good climb today, just before our lunch break.  Jane had a little problem with her chain at the bottom of the climb and ended up talking with one of the local farmers for quite some time before she got a ride in the van to our lunch stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another fun feature of riding in Ireland is that occasionally some sheep will be right on the road.  Here you can see Jane herding a small flock out of our way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1063.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1063.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our lunch we continued along the fjord until we turned onto the coast.  We stopped to check out the peat bogs, and have a little afternoon snack of some Harps Lager and nuts.  Once again the views were just amazing.  Now we are at Roseleague Manor.  There were a lot of rolling hills today so we are just chilling, catching up and email and blogging until our next meal.  when DuVine says their motto is "Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep" they really are not kidding.  We've had fantastic food everywhere so far, and I feel like every calorie I bike off, I immediately consume at the next snack stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2131677003684979934?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>connemara and castles</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/connemara-and-castles.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-29:/PelicanBlog/connemara-and-castles.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are staying in a castle!

Ashford castle to be precise.  It's about an hour outside of Galway and it's absolutely beautiful.  We arrived yesterday afternoon with our DuVine Adventures guides Kirk and Padraic.  Yesterday was mostly about checking to the room, getting our bikes fit, and getting to know our fellow cyclists.  There are a total of 12 of us on the trip and everyone is really nice.  There are no other young adults on the trip but so far everyone has been very welcoming of Josh and Kaia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning we woke up to what the irish call a soft rain, we might call it a mist but I like the irish term better.  It really is so soft that you forget about the precipitation until you are totally soaked by it.  We had a nice breakfast here at the castle and then Josh and I went golfing at the nine hole course, and Jane went along with some of our fellow cyclists to a falconry class.  It was amazing, they got to wear the leather glove, and the falcon would take off and land from their arm.  Meanwhile Josh and I were sharing a set of clubs and getting soaked while playing some golf in Ireland.  The course was not too hard, and on the par three I almost got a legitimate hole in one, see my previous post on St. Andrews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/0.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At noon we took off on our first true ride of the tour.  We cycled up the road a bit to stop for lunch in a small pub.  The only problem was that the soft rain had not abated, and according to our head waiter at the castle, "If its still raining at 11, its probably going to keep raining all day."  It really was a soft rain and although we were all quite wet at our lunch stop we dried out rather quickly as well.  Our destination for the afternoon was Joyce Country Sheepdogs.  Here we Met Joe Joyce who is a sheep farmer and breeder of working dogs.  If you have seen Marley and Me, you have seen Joe's sheep and one of his dogs (not Marley -- Its the scene where the sheep are blocking the road)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe showed us how the dogs herd the sheep and how they respond to his verbal or whistled commands.  He lives in a beautiful stone house, and his sheep roam the mountains across the lake from his home.  When he needs to bring the sheep in for something, which happens five times a year, he brings his dogs across the lake and he commands them using his whistle from a boat where he has a better view.  These dogs are amazing, they WANT to work so hard for him they go crazy when its not their turn to herd the sheep.  I should say it rained on us the last couple of miles to Joe's house so we were all like drowned rats when we got their.  Thankfully while we were there the rain let up and the sun started to break through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/2.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_2.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ride back was even more beautiful than the ride out, thanks in large part to the lack of rain.  Its amazing how green and beautiful the Irish countryside is.  The mountains go directly down to the lake shore and the lakes themselves are incredibly beautiful.  Tonight we had our second amazing dinner at the castle, this dinner was much less formal than last night's sport coat and tie affair, but my seafood chowder was to die for, the fish and chips were good, and then the desert, a white chocolate rhubarb tart was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/3.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_3.jpg' border='0' width='210' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we have about 40 miles to bike to our next destination and another delicious dinner, I'm already looking forward to it, and I hope we will have sun all day tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4754161074077029100?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>world cup disappointment in galway</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/world-cup-disappointment-in-galway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-27:/PelicanBlog/world-cup-disappointment-in-galway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other night on our pub crawl, Eugene told us a story about the Irish people and how they would conquer the world.

He started with the excuse that Ireland has been invaded by just about everyone else on the planet, and how Ireland has a hopeless military;  but went on to describe their master plan.  According to Eugene when you go into a bar in Ireland you are likely to be ignored for a while, but if you stick around eventually someone will come up and start talking to you.  This is not because they are especially friendly, but because the are especially nosey.  "Within 15 minutes they will have your name, your parents names, your grandparents names, and your home address."  This information is useful he says because sometime in the future, when you least expect it "this person will show up on your door with a sleeping bag in hand."  They'll find a quite place to settle down and sometime later fifteen of them will emerge!  And this is how Ireland will conquer the world.  We all laughed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night at Fagan's pub we experienced part one of this scenario.  We were watching the USA versus Ghana match having a nice time, enjoying a pint and some appetizers, and being cheerfully ignored by all the locals. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around awkwardly to find a red-haired man in a gold and green striped jersey wishing the USA good luck. He wanted to know if we were on holiday here in Ireland? If we were football fans? How long we were staying?  What we were doing in Galway? What was our surname?  Where were we from?  (city and state)  As this very friendly irishman took a break of his inquisition to get another pint, Josh leaned over to me and said "Dad he's going to show up on our door with his sleeping bag!"  I just about fell on the floor laughing!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partway through the second half the whole scenario repeated itself with two different guys.  It was all great fun, especially when Donovan tied up the score on his PK and the whole pub was cheering.  Sadly that all came to an end early on in the overtime period when our world cup hopes for USA were dashed.  Now we are left to wonder who to cheer for and whether our enthusiasm for watching world cup will wane after this defeat.  We have watched a lot of football on this trip, its been a fun constant for us in a sea of daily change.  Its forced us to sit down and relax at 4:00 or 8:30 most days rather than continuing to tour and walk.  Its revived my taste for a good pint of beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Galway,%20Ireland&amp;z=10'&gt;Galway, Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8554259399871208957?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>a day in dublin</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-day-in-dublin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-26:/PelicanBlog/a-day-in-dublin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning we are on the train from Dublin to Galway.

We woke up to a bright blue sky in Dublin, packed up our belongings, and left our little apartment for the tram to the train station.  Although the apartment itself was a bit sketchy it was in a great neighborhood and we had wonderful restaurants up and down the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night we had a wonderful Thai meal at Koh.  We shared three appetizers and three main course dishes.  For the appetizers we had mixed satays, vietnamese beef balls, and ceviche.  All were delicious.  For the main course we shared green curry with chicken, cashew chicken, and panang curry with beef.  I think we each had our own favorite it was all so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was definitely a full day of touristing in Dublin.  We started off our day on the hop-on-hop-off tour bus.  Our first hop-off was at the Guinness storehouse.  This is a building that Guinness has turned into a monument to all things Guinness.  The building is designed so that your tour takes you around and around and on a spiral upward around the worlds largest Guinness pint glass.  We learned about how Guinness is brewed, about the history of Guinness, and how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness.  At the Gravity bar at the very top of the pint glass we were in an all glass circular room with great views of Dublin, there we could trade our ticket for..... A pint of Guinness!  Here's Josh and I in front of the waterfall...good pure water is key to making Guinness.  Mr Guiness signed a 9000 year lease for the land on which the brewery sits in part because of it's access to the pure water flowing in from the Dublin Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/731.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/s_731.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Guinness tour we hopped back on the bus and headed for the Gaol. By this time we were very hungry and so we decided to find a bit of lunch.  There was not much to choose from in the area around the Gaol but Dolce Vita caught our attention almost right away.  We had some very nice pizzas and Kaia had a steaming hot bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kilmainham Gaol is a famous site in Dublin as it is the place where 14 of the 16 leaders of the Easter rebellion were executed.  It is a very old gaol and the history goes back well before the time of the potato famine in Ireland.  It was during the famine that the overcrowding at the gaol was at its worst.  The gaol has been featured in several movies including Michael Connelly, and the original version of The Italian Job.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/732.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/s_732.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we had finished our guided tour of the gaol our feet were tired so we hopped back on the bus and rode it all the way around to where we had started.  Along the way we saw lots of other sites of Dublin.  The hop-on-hop-off busses are all double decker busses with open tops so we sat up top and enjoyed the scenery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We returned to our apartment for a little break and decided to head out to find a pub with internet access.  We chose the Church bar, which is a bar/restaurant that has emerged from the remodeled Saint Mary's church in Dublin.  This is the first bar I've been in that has its own pipe organ!  The pipe organ, built in the 18th century was used by G. F. Handel.  In addition there are several famous people who are buried in the church/pub, and there have been some important weddings including Alfred Guinness.  How appropriate to have a pint of Guinness in the place where he was married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After happy hour and then dinner at Koh we were all ready to just kick back and watch the world cup match in our apartment while we finished up washing all of our clothes.  The match between Chile and Spain was a yawner, as chile seemed to be willing to place their hopes on Switzerland playing to a draw.  Its been very interesting traveling to all of the different companies during the world cup competition.  We have seen lots of different kinds of coverage and commentators.  Last night on Irish TV there were four  very old guys who spent forever dissecting the match and making the case that Spain was really going to have to pick up their game if they had any hope of progressing during the elimination round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is a pretty light day.  We'll get in to Galway just after noon, and we don't have much planned other than some light walking around and scoping out somewhere to watch USA play tonight.  Josh and I are both wearing our USA jerseys today.  Good Luck team USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=On%20the%20train%20from%20Dublin%20to%20Galway&amp;z=10'&gt;On the train from Dublin to Galway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6269981965266059478?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>the roller derby queen in dublin</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-roller-derby-queen-in-dublin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-25:/PelicanBlog/the-roller-derby-queen-in-dublin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well last night a bit of Dublin had a taste of some Jim Croce music.

I'm not sure where it came from but we were enjoying the musical pub crawl that started in Tower Square.  Our two guides for the night were Eugene, who played the Irish banjo, and Steve who was a guitar player.  After a couple of pubs and a lot of good Irish Jigs and Reels, and some history of Irish music and instruments were were walking between pubs and I started up a conversation with Steve.  Steve also plays a Taylor guitar and it is the same model I have at home.  That was the kiss of death.  "What is your name?" asks Eugene.  Brad, I say.  "Now we've got you" says Eugene, at this next stop you'll have to play a little for us.  Uh, I don't think thats a very good idea I said.  We talk a little more about what kind of music I like to play and where we are visiting in Ireland and where we have already been.  Steve mentions that he is a fan of Prairie Home Companion and how some of the things that Keillor talks about on the show remind him of Ireland and I'm thinking I'm safe and the whole sing for us thing was simply a fun idle threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/25/206.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/25/s_206.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we get to the next pub and the duo works through a couple more songs Eugene starts in on a long story about how its an Irish tradition to join in on a session and it doesn't matter how good you are or if you even just sing one verse or whatever, its all in good fun.  The next thing I know Steve is handing me the Taylor and a pick I'm I'm thinking what the heck am I going to play!?  Roller Derby Queen is Jane's suggestion and I think I can probably remember the chords and the words, so I start to strum a little bit to see if I can recall the right chords and pretty soon I'm singing.  I make it through a couple of versus without too many mistakes and finish up to the applause of the rest of the pub crawlers. Thankfully they all had had a few pints of Guinness by now so they were not an overly discriminating audience.  Anyway, it was great fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that its the next morning and I'm thinking about it, I realize that I really have quite an international performance background.  I've played in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa.  I've played with a group of Tahitians sitting in a plastic lawn chair in the South Seas. And now I've played on an Irish pub crawl in Dublin.  It makes me wonder where I could go if I practiced some more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the pub crawl was over, we found a little Italian place that was still serving pasta at 10:30 at night and finished off our first day in Dublin.  The day had started out very early, in Stockholm with a train ride to the Arlanda airport.  We flew SAS from Stockholm to Dublin and then took a bus from the airport to the city center of Dublin.  Here in Dublin we are staying in one of the StayDublin.com apartments.   Its a bit sketchy and in need of paint and a good cleaning but the apartment has two bedrooms a living room a kitchen with one of those funky european washer/dryer units.  If anyone can tell me out to operate one of those things properly please send me an email.  We cannot get the dryer to work for anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After unloading our stuff at the apartment we started to explore the area a little.  We found a restaurant called Boojum, right by our apartment that is operated by a man from Philadelphia.  If you are looking for your fix of Chipotle right here in the heart of Dublin then Boojum is for you.  It was a nice lunch, and I think Josh was really happy with the food.  We took a tour of Trinity College and saw the Book of Kells.  This is an amazingly old illuminated version of the four gospels that has been preserved by the Trinity library, its a really interesting exhibit, and we had a great guide who is a student at Trinity and works for Ark.com, Ark sells clothing and the idea is that every time you wear an article of Ark clothing you perform An Act of Random Kindness.  Thats where the Ark name comes from.  The library at Trinity was also extremely interesting to me for two reasons.  First it is the largest single room library in Europe.  Its just beautiful to see books and bookshelves stretched out for a city block.  But the second reason is interesting to my twisted computer science mind because of how the books are organized in the library.  The books are sorted by SIZE!  In order to find a book in this library you must know the exact dimensions of the book to get you to the proper shelf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tour of Trinity we just walked around and enjoyed the street performers and the shops of Dublin.  Josh wanted to go to the Leprechaun museum but he was out voted 3 to 1.  So we went back to the apartment to rest our feet and find an internet cafe to catch up on email and Facebook before the pub crawl.  Today we are doing a hop-on-hop-off tour of the city and plan to take the tour of the Guiness Brewery and the Dublin Gaol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Dublin,%20Ireland&amp;z=10'&gt;Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4716558466489004136?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>ship building lessons in stockholm</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/ship-building-lessons-in-stockholm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-23:/PelicanBlog/ship-building-lessons-in-stockholm.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we heard the name Gustavus Adophus quite a lot.

With apologies to my friends in St. Peter I must say he didn't know much about ship building.  In all truth it really wasn't his fault from a technical point of view, but he did pay the bill.  I am talking about the Vasa of course.  It is the largest ship to be recovered and salvaged and conserved in a museum.  This is definitely a must see sight if you go to Stockholm.  The Vasa was built in 1628 and was the largest ship in the Swedish fleet.  Unfortunately she sunk on her maiden voyage out of the harbor!  The reason she sank was because there was not enough ballast in the ship to counterbalance the forces on the sails in the heavy breeze.  This seems like an incredibly dumb mistake for a ship builder to make, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1331.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1331.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ship lay submerged for 333 years until an amazing recovery operation in the 1960's brought the ship to the surface.  The Vasa is amazingly well preserved due to the water conditions in the Baltic.   The museum is just as interesting for the story of how the ship was raised to the surface and preserved as it was to learn about the building of the ship in 1628.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vasa Museum was our first stop today in Stockholm.  Our day started early as we had to debark from the vision of the seas by 7:40.  The sailing in to Stockholm was once again beautiful and very reminiscent of Wisconsin and Northern Minnesota.  We are all very lonely for our cabin at the sight of water, boats, rave trampolines and all the pine trees.  The rest of the morning we wandered around stockholm enjoying the shops and the old town.  We did a little shopping.  I got an official USA soccer jersey to wear for the game today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1332.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1332.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After walking around all morning we returned to our hotel to check in and rest up a bit.  We are staying in the Rica Hotel on Gamla Stan in a wonderful part of stockholm.  The streets around here are narrow and cobbled and there are restaurants and bars and little shops everywhere.  We hunted around a little bit to decide where to have a late afternoon dinner and watch the USA versus Algeria match.  We found O'Leary's, a boston themed restaurant owned by a swede who spent time in Boston.  They had the England match on upstairs and the USA match on down.  The American fans were many and much louder than the brits.  In a funny small world moment I recognized one of the other fans in the restaurant as the same person we had watched football with when we were in Balestrand!  They were originally from Minnesota but had moved to Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To catch up on our activities, yesterday we were in Tallin Estonia, and the day before was a day at sea.  Tallin was a really nice city, it has the oldest medieval walled city in Europe.  The city reminded us a little of Italy and of some of the walled cities we had visited in Tuscany.  The city is an interesting mix of scandinavian and Russian influences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1333.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1333.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1334.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1334.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane had a walking tour of the city that we got on the internet and we followed that plan around the city for several hours.  After that we returned to the ship for our last night on board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are having a great time, but we are all very tired today.  We just didn't have a lot of energy for many touring activities.  And the USA victory took a lot of energy as well.  Early to bed tonight, but up again early tomorrow morning for our flight to Dublin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Stockholm,%20Sweden&amp;z=10'&gt;Stockholm, Sweden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1679743920454965479?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>bon voyage oslo</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/bon-voyage-oslo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-21:/PelicanBlog/bon-voyage-oslo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I write this we are just pulling in to Copenhagen Denmark aboard the Vision of the Seas.

We have a wonderful family suite on board, and that is nice because it gives us all a little of our own space for a few days.  We did have a really great hotel in Oslo. The Thon Oslo Panorama, if you are looking for a hotel in Oslo at a reasonable price you would do very well here.  The room that we rented was one of their studio apartments, so it had a washer/dryer and a small kitchen.  It had a separate bedroom, and a living area with a pull out couch.  If you need a couple days to wash clothes and rest up this is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Oslo activities were pretty low key.  We took the ferry over to Bygdol to visit a few of the many museums.  We visited a Stave church, and the viking ship museum.  For me the highlight was the Kon-Tiki museum, which is dedicated to Thor Hyerdal.  Hyerdal is the explorer and adventurer that made two primitive craft to travel across the Atlantic and the Pacific.  The purpose was to show that it would have been possible for early residents of Africa to make it to south america, or for early inhabitants of South America to make it to the south seas.  The originals of both the Kon-Tiki and the Ra-II are on display at the museum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/9.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_9.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a day of touring we found the Scotsman Pub, which had two very large  projection screens, and an assortment of fans ready to cheer for the USA.  Sadly the USA put itself in a hole the first half, and although we did come back and win the game 3-2 the idiot ref disallowed the final goal and we had to settle for a 2-2 tie.  Again it was great fun to be in a foreign pub with everyone cheering for USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the game we walked around the downtown area, took a tram out to a huge sculpture park, and finally found some tex-mex (or as some here in Norway say mex-tex) restaurant for some comfort food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night we sailed away and enjoyed a glass of champagne on our balcony&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/10.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_10.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were once again amazed by the beauty of Norway.  All of the little islands with houses on them are really striking as you cruise by.  It reminds you a lot of Wisconsin and Northern Minnesota only with more water than land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/11.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_11.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed that our bodies seem to have adjusted to this latitude and the lack of darkness.  I don't think that we have been to bed before midnight in well over a week, and yet we keep getting up in the morning ready to go.  Last night was no exception.  We had a great dinner with a family from Florida, explored the ship, tried out the casino and enjoyed some piano music.  We watched Denmark play its world cup match with some fans from Sweden.  The Swedes were cheering for Cameroon as they are not happy with Denmark for knocking them out of the World Cup competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Oslo,%20Norway&amp;z=10'&gt;Oslo, Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3502383692150352605?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>read all about it, biking with mike is great</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/read-all-about-it-biking-with-mike-is-great.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-21:/PelicanBlog/read-all-about-it-biking-with-mike-is-great.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After days and days of using our feet to get around european cities it was time for a change, and what better city to try two wheeled touring in than Copenhagen.

Copenhagen has more bikes than anywhere else in the world.  They make the people of Portland look like a bunch of slackers.  There are literally bikes everywhere.  At the train stations there are bike racks two stories high, there are bike racks everywhere and people riding their bikes everywhere.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane found Biking with Mike on the internet, he is a lifelong resident of Copenhagen who left his job as a director at a large company to do what he loves -- bike and tell people about his city.  There is no fancy signup procedure as each days tours are first come first served.  If the weather is horrible there won't be a tour.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the ship at 9:30 and headed straight for Mike's bike shop.  We knew the tour was not until 10:30 but we wanted to make sure we got a spot on the tour.  We arrived by taxi 5 minutes later, but the shop did not even open until 10:00.  So we walked around the area a little bit and decided to get a coffee at the cafe up the block from Mike's.  One minor problem was that we hadn't taken the time to find a cash machine and get some Danish Kroners.  After preparing our coffee we discovered that the credit card reader in the coffee shop was not working properly, and so we were unable to pay.  In Decorah, this would not really be a problem, go find some money and pay me later.  Who would have guessed that we would find the same attitude in a big city?  This appears to be the Danish way.  The proprietor of the coffee shop was perfectly happy to have us go on our bike tour, get some cash, and pay him later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after 10 Mike arrived.  Bright green stocking hat, bright green shoes, a yellow and black livestrong vest and fashionable glasses.  His bike matched his cycling outfit.  Mike took us on a tour for a little over 3 hours.  We saw the palace, the castle, the parliament buildings, the house where Hans Christian Anderson was born, the new opera house, a couple of parks, and a little lawless place called Christiana.  We would bike for a while and then stop and mike would give us a short lecture on what were were looking at, Danish politics, Danish culture, local gossip, you name it and MIke knew about it.  He is an excellent story teller.  As we were riding there was no talking, the idea is to absorb the local feeling of the place as you are riding rather than chatting.  It worked.  It was fun, we saw a lot of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/439.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_439.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christiana was the most interesting stop on the tour.  We had coffee in the moonshine cafe.  It is the safest coffee house in Copenhagen. Why?  The sign on the door tells the story.  More than 6000 police inspections since 2004.  Christiana is the counter culture area of Copenhagen, Mike discouraged us from taking any pictures in the area because you never know when you might accidentally capture a deal going down, and they don't like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We learned one word of Danish that really sums up our Copenhagen experience.  The word is Hygglite, it is difficult to describe exactly what it means, cozy is one possible translation while fantastic is another.  Internet people might translate it as "A Good Thing."  Its a word they use in Denmark to describe when something is just right and good.  Our bike tour of Copenhagen with mike was definitely Hygglite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/440.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_440.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the conclusion of our tour we paid mike and headed, on foot, back through the park on the way to the ship.  When we emerged from the park, there was Mike on his bike.  Hello he said, I wonder if you might have a few minute to talk to a reporter from the paper Politik?  Its the largest Danish paper and they are doing a story about touring copenhagen on bike.  It seems that the reporter for the paper was planning to go on Mike's afternoon tour, but because of the oncoming rain Mike had cancelled the afternoon tour.  So, we agreed to spend a few minutes talking to the reporter and then we got our picture taken by one of the photographers from the paper.  So, if you speak Danish you can read about the Miller family and our bike fun in the city of Copenhagen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Copenhagen,%20Denmark&amp;z=10'&gt;Copenhagen, Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2200921901605184937?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>the nœrøyfjorden</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/the-n-r-yfjorden.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-18:/PelicanBlog/the-n-r-yfjorden.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning we got to sleep in, have a relaxing breakfast, catch up on some email and reading, and then we started our long day's journey.

As I'm writing this its 10:45 and we are still an hour out of Oslo.  Of course it is also still full daylight outside, and we are hopeful that it will still be light for our short walk to the hotel when we arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first leg of our trip today started with the same Sognefjorden ferry that we arrived in Balestrand on yesterday.  Only this time we rode it for only 45 minutes.  When made a mid-fjord transfer to another ferry, this one was actually a passenger and car ferry, which took us down the "Narrow Fjord"  This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is the narrowest fjord with boat traffic on it.  It is spectacular!  We stopped counting waterfalls because there were simply too many.  The steepness of the cliffs coming down to the water was just beautiful.  We passed three tiny villages that have no roads leading to them, the only way in or out is by boat.  The natural scenic beauty of this part of the world really is stunning.  Along the way in the fjord I had a quick glimpse of two porpoises as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/1375.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/s_1375.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/1376.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/s_1376.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our final destination for this ferry was  Gudvangen, this is a tiny little town on the other side of two very long tunnels from Fløm.  There is not much here except for some souvenir shops, a small restaurant, and the ferry landing.  We had about an hour and half to wait for our bus to Fløm.  The bus stop was literally a wide spot in the highway from Bergen, but our bus was right on time to take us to Fløm.  Right outside of town was the first tunnel, it was 11.4 kilometers long.  We had a short break and then another 5 kilometer tunnel.  After this tunnel we were in Fløm, and the railway station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/1377.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/s_1377.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final legs of the journey are by train, we started off on the Fløm railway. Which goes up into the mountains 20km, at about a 55 degree slope!  It is the steepest non-cogwheel railway anywhere.  Again the scenery and waterfalls were marvelous.  We spent the entire trip looking out the windows of the train and snapping pictures as fast as we could.  We were not quite sure about this train trip when we first boarded as a hoard of toga clad norwegians got onto the same train car as us.  They were quite loud and all carrying a can of the local brew.  They were on the train for less than 1 km before they all got off the train, in the middle of nowhere.  For all we know they are still wandering around the hills near Fløm celebrating some strange holiday we don't know about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/1378.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/18/s_1378.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final stop of the Fløm railway is at Myrdral which basically consists of a train station up in the mountains.  When we got off the train it was actually snowing!  We had a short wait for the Bergen to Oslo train to come along and we jumped on.  We have been riding in Coach 2, which looks to be the student car on the train.  It seems that many students from Bergen must be returned home to Oslo for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we will check into the Thon hotel in Oslo, and I suspect we will all sleep in again tomorrow morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Norway&amp;z=10'&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2524657992767485536?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>beautiful balestrand</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/beautiful-balestrand.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-17:/PelicanBlog/beautiful-balestrand.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the late night heavy metal concert in Bergen, we were all very ready for some peace and quiet.

We found it in Balestrand Norway.  To get to Balestrand we took the early morning Ferry out of Bergen, and came up through the Fjords to get here.  The Beauty of the Fjords is beyond describing in words, so here are a few pictures.  First, leaving Bergen on the Ferry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/99.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/s_99.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Bergen, we travelled North, between the coast, and all the little islands that protect the coast from the North sea.  After about two hours we turned inland into Sognefjord, The longest and deepest fjord in Norway.  From here on, it was just one beautiful sight after another.  Here's a typical picture from the back of the ferry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/100.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/s_100.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All along the fjords you see these nice houses either up on the hillside, or tucked down near the water.  Sometimes there is a boathouse right over the water as in the picture above.  Notice how still the water is, and the contrast of the green of the trees on the shore with this stunning blue water is just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we arrived in Balestrand we were met by our host, one member of the family that owns and runs the Balestrand Hotel, which is in my mind the nicest and friendliest place we have stayed yet.  The rooms have an amazing view out over the fjord, as you can see from this shot out off the deck of our hotel room.  If you go to Balestrand, you should definitely stay here, and don't be afraid to upgrade to the fjord view, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/101.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/s_101.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rooms here, have no TV in them, but who needs a TV when you have a view like this?  We did go downstairs to the lobby area where they have a breakfast room, a reading room, with computer, and a TV area.  We enjoyed watching some football with a very international crowd.  Its interesting hearing the perspectives of the other people on the games, and of course its different to watch the football match when the announcers are speaking in Norwegian.  The truth is its kind of a welcome relief from the English announcers.  All they do is talk about England this and England that...  I suppose the American announcers are the same way, and they probably talk way too much.  The truth is you don't need an announcer telling you much when you watch football.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balestrand is not a very large town, we were able to walk everywhere from our hotel, and see just about everything.  There is a small aquarium that shows you some of the sea life living in the fjords, a couple of small lunch places and one other hotel called the Kviknes.  Hotel Kviknes is the largest wooden structure in Scandanavia.  We ended up having supper there last night and it was quite good.  I had a wonderful veal, Jane had risotto, Kaia pasta, and josh had a triple decker club sandwich.  While were were seated we struck up a conversation with an older british couple and had a very nice chat.  It is interesting to hear the English perspective on what is going on with the BP oil spill in the gulf of mexico.  It is clear that although the british people have been supportive of Obama in the past many are taking his anger at BP somewhat personally.  Of course football is alway another good topic to take up with the Brits, luckily this couple were very sportsmanlike about our competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning we were able to sleep in and have a nice breakfast in the hotel.  At noon we board the ferry again, and head for Oslo.  Today is a travel Odyssey, we'll be on two ferries, a bus, and two trains to take us to Oslo.  We won't get in until after 11:00 tonight, but of course it will still be broad daylight so we aren't particularly worried.  I'll leave you with one more image of the fjords and beautiful Balestrand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/102.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/17/s_102.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Balestrand,%20Norway&amp;z=10'&gt;Balestrand, Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1661342914662128360?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>heavy metal in bergen</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/heavy-metal-in-bergen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-15:/PelicanBlog/heavy-metal-in-bergen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night after we ate our dinner at the Ship Inn we came out to this sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/1172.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/s_1172.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tide had gone out and left all of the boats stranded on the sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/1173.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/s_1173.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning we flew from Aberdeen Scotland to Bergen Norway, the landing was absolutely spectacular.

I've never seen so many small islands in my life.  Plus, the sky was perfectly blue for the first time in many days, and so the whole scene was amazing.  Getting through customs and the rest of the airport went just as smoothly as you would expect from a scandinavian country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We immediately found our SAS Airbus to take us downtown to our hotel.  We are at the Hotel Thon, it is on the end of Byrggen Street, right across the road from the harbor.  Its a very nice location, except that it is next to a huge city park.  What is wrong with that you may ask.  Well, it turns out that we picked the wrong night to stay at the Thon hotel next to the park, as tonight is the night of the Rammstein concert.  Who are Rammstein you may ask? After a little internet searching I quickly learned that Rammstein are a German industrial metal band.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are actually on the opposite side of the hotel from the concert but at the moment it is making no difference.  We are trying to watch the world cup, but the sound from the concert is so loud it is drowning out the Brazilian national anthem.  I would much prefer the sounds of those dumb world cup horns to the sound of a german industrial metal band.  We can only hope that the concert will wrap up at a respectable time.  Josh just found a view of the concert and said it looks like a bunch of black ants (yes all the concert goers are dressed in black T-shirts) streaming toward a rotting apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, enough grousing, Bergen really is a nice city.  We started our tour of Bergen by meeting one of Kaia's facebook friends named Thomas at our hotel.  Thomas had visited Decorah with a group of Norwegian students a couple of years ago, and volunteered to get us oriented to the city when he saw Kaia's Facebook status.  He showed us around the area including the wharf and the fish market and the central park of Bergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane and Kaia spent some time shopping around the city for a sweater for Kaia.  They were successful, and so Kaia can proudly celebrate her heritage at concord, and at Christmas time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took the Funicular up high above the city this afternoon and the view is amazing.  We took Thomas' recommendation for a restaurant for supper tonight and went to Egon's.  It is a Norwegian chain restaurant and the food was OK.  I think we have officially reached the point of vacation where choosing a place to eat for supper and dinner in a new strange city has become somewhat of a chore.  We miss the home cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/1174.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/s_1174.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow morning we have another fairly early morning, as we must be on board our ferry boat at 8 AM for the trip to Balestrand, of course early morning takes on a whole new connotation at this time of the year at this latitude.   We are now far enough north that there is only a couple hours of darkness at this time of the year.  Darkness is only from midnight until a little after 2 AM.  The Ferry trip tomorrow promises to be a beautiful trip through the fjords, we are all looking forward to it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now we are resting and watching Brazil and the People's Republic of Korea play some football.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bergen,%20Norway&amp;z=10'&gt;Bergen, Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7886036605437936476?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>st. andrews hole in one!</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/st-andrews-hole-in-one.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-14:/PelicanBlog/st-andrews-hole-in-one.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can you possibly imagine a better way to top off a trip to St. Andrews than with a hole in one?

Well thats what I did!!  Josh and I were playing this morning, and it was on the 16th hole.  I hit my drive perfectly straight, just a little left of the pin, right where I had aimed it.  It rolled, broke to the right and dropped straight into the cup.   Here's where the story gets really weird, two holes later, Josh also got a hole in one.  Thats right, on number 18 at St. Andrews.  He hit his drive past the hole, up the hill, and it rolled straight back down into the cup.  A truly amazing shot.  You may be wondering which course we were on.  Well unfortunately it was not the old course.  It was a course called the Himalayas and it is the official putting green of the old course.  They have 18 holes laid out, and you can rent a putter and balls.  No, silly clowns mouths or windmills allowed, this is just a very challenging, and highly rolling putting green.  In fact we had to wait until 11:00 this morning to tee off because they have a ladies putting league that plays before that.  It is complete with its own clubhouse and everything.  Here I am in my fashionable St. Andrews argyle sweater, getting ready to tee it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/1112.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/s_1112.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived in St. Andrews yesterday afternoon, after visiting Castle Edinburgh in the morning.  The castle was very interesting, and we again learned some interesting Scottish history.  We stayed in the hotel Rusacks' which looks right out over the 18th Fairway on the old course.  We could sit in our room and look out at both number 1 and 18 fairways.  They have already done a lot of work getting ready for the Open.  This is the last week that the public can play on the course until afterwards.  So there are lots of grandstands under construction.   The great thing is that the course is closed on sunday so the public can walk the course.  So we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've talked a lot these last few days about walking where other famous people have walked.  We've walked the same rooms and stairways as Mary Queen of Scots, King Henry the VIII, Oliver Cromwell, and many others.  Now we can add to our list Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklas, Old Tom Murray, and even Tiger.  The room that we stayed in at Rusacks is the same room used by Arnold Palmer, and other golfers.  In addition Mick Jagger also stayed in our room.  I don't know that Mick cares about golf but he was on the list.  I'm sure they will be adding the Miller family to the list any day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to walking the course, it was really fun to walk along and remember seeing some of our golfing hero's and where they hit great shots and where they got in trouble.  We found lots of deep bunkers to take our picture in too.  Here is one of me on the Swilcan Bridge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/1113.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/s_1113.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blog entry would not be complete without a little culinary update.  Last night we ate at Nahm-Jim  a Thai restaurant right in the heart of St. Andrews.  We had some delicious curry, and Josh claims he had the best Pad-Thai of his life there.  Very good stuff.  After dinner the tide had gone way out, so Josh and I hiked out on the beach, we got a great look back at St. Andrews.  You can see the Golf museum lit up on the far right, and some of the temporary construction they have stared for the open, also on the far right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/1114.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/s_1114.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a very light lunch in St. Andrews today, we finally gave in to Josh's urge to have a Subway Sandwich, we drove to Stonehaven.  Stonehaven is a small town outside Aberdeen,  its probably about the same size as Decorah, but its right on the North Sea.  Our Bed and Breakfast overlooks the town harbor and is really beautiful.  We took an Awesome hike out to Donnotter castle.  This castle is all in ruins but it is such a great setting, its was really amazing.  This is the site where they filmed Mel Gibson's version of Hamlet.   This picture gives you a sense for how isolated the castle is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/1115.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/14/s_1115.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Andrews,%20Scotland&amp;z=10'&gt;St. Andrews, Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1364485448609623717?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>a draw in edinburg</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-draw-in-edinburg.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-13:/PelicanBlog/a-draw-in-edinburg.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One week after watching our Decorah Vikings take third in the state soccer tournament we were back watching futbol again.

This time we were in Edinburgh Scotland watching USA play England.  Now before you get too worried about us cheering for our side on the home turf of our opponent let me just clarify that when England is playing the Scottish will cheer very loudly for the other team!  As soon as we arrived in Edinburgh Josh. Changed into his USA jersey, and as we were waking around Edinburgh he got lots of comments from the locals.  "nice top there son"  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it came to pass that we found ourselves in a hotel bar with lots of support for USA.  On one side was a group of about 20 younger scottish men, and on the other were some additional tourists like ourselves.  We had hoped to experience the game in a pub, but unfortunately they do not allow minors after 8pm.  It was great fun to watch the game here, but I must say that I have grown used to the expert commentary of my friend Jim, who is leading a group of Luther alumni on a trip through Germany at the moment.  I am sure Jim found a good place to watch the game there with some German support.  You see all kinds of people when you watch the game in a hotel bar.  At one point an Asian man came in, and stared at the screen for a couple of minutes before asking "what half is it?". One of our scottish compatriots replied, well I don't know where you're from mate but when the clock says forty two minutes here you're in the first half.  It sounds even funnier when you hear it with the accent.  Needless to say that particular fan did not stick around to watch much of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Americans scored (yes it was an error on the English keeper) the whole bar erupted in cheers and then a chant of USA USA started up.  The bar manager looked like he couldn't decide what to do.  He clearly wanted to  calm everyone down and was obviously worried that a riot was going to break out in his bar.   But he had no idea how what the right strategy was.  In the end order was restored by some humor.  After the cheers erupted and the chant had started one of the scottish fans came running back into the room to see what all of the commotion was about.  As he had been in the toilet, he made a great show of zipping up his zipper which put everyone to laughing, including the manager.  Although I was disappointed to settle for the draw, I think it is a good result for the American side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the day we did spend some time walking around Edinburgh, we walked the Royal Mile, and checked out Holyrood House.  We have now seen all the royal residences except for Balmoral.  The big story of Holyrood is that this is where Mary Queen of Scots spent a lot of time, and it is also where her young son was killed right before her eyes by her husband.  Nice guy, who wanted the throne bad enough to kill his stepson.  Here is a picture of the Abbey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/13/157.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/13/s_157.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hotel here is great, we are right in the middle of a bustling area, and have a awesome view of Edinburgh castle out our hotel window.  Here is a night shot I took after the world cup game was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/13/158.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/13/s_158.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we are going to visit the castle, then pick up our rental car and head for St. Andrews, birthplace of golf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Edinburgh,%20Scotland%20&amp;z=10'&gt;Edinburgh, Scotland &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4974440520446382053?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>random rants on a train</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/random-rants-on-a-train.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-12:/PelicanBlog/random-rants-on-a-train.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing this on the train from London to Edinburgh where they have just announced the breakfast options.

I don't get the concept of "English breakfast."  I would like to meet the chef who came up with the idea of serving baked beans and eggs together!  My guess is that if I did meet him I would learn that he was also the inventor of the "Pudding Menu."  At every hotel the included breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, and baked beans. I don't like baked beans under the best of conditions, and certainly not first thing in the morning.  I guess it must be one of those things you need to grow up with in order to appreciate.  In the meantime I will just stick to having tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now that I have addressed the breakfast issue I will praise the train system.  This is really a the way to travel.  We have four seats facing each other in coach, tons of legroom, a table in between us, great scenery, free wifi, and a very quiet ride.  No long hassles of getting to the station 90 minutes ahead of time, and no long security lines.  Just walk to the platform, get on your train, stow your luggage and take a seat.  As we reevaluate travel the US I really wonder what it would take to get this kind of convenience.  I, for one would travel this way whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say how much I love traveling with my iPad!  This thing is great.  It's small, light, the battery life is awesome, I have a bunch of books to read on it, a couple of movies to watch, the current season of Merlin, and games to entertain me when I am tired of all of the above. Other than if I really needed to write a program I can not imagine why I would ever need to travel with a laptop.  In fact I think this is really the start of something new.  I don't see myself needing a laptop.  My setup would be a nice big desktop machine for programming and writing in LaTeX, and my iPad for the times I am not at my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as long as I'm rambling on about products and travel I have to say that I love my ScotteVest. (www.scottevest.com).  Its a vest designed for travel, that includes zip pockets for just about everything.  I can carry camera lenses, glasses, iPod, phone, and all kinds of things.  I think it has 20 pockets in total, so there is a pocket for just about everything.  It keeps me warm at the temperatures we are traveling in at the moment, and with all the zippers and inner pockets I feel pretty secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5627967196197647954?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>adventure in the white tower</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/adventure-in-the-white-tower.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-11:/PelicanBlog/adventure-in-the-white-tower.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's travel adventure involved the Tower of London.

No, we were not arrested and tortured by the English royalty.  We were on a tour of the tower of london.  We had just finished the guided tour with one of the Yoman Warders (cool title eh?) and we decided to go in and check out the Armoury. (yep I'm converting to british spelling)  Just after we got in the door an alarm started to go off, and a woman steward came hurrying buy and told us that we had to evacuate the tower.  We were never able to to find out why we had to evacuate but Jane overheard a couple of them talking about a fire alarm.  The tower of London is also the site where Henry VIII beheaded several of his wives, including Anne Boleyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started our day by taking the tube to St. Paul's Cathedral.  After walking around the sanctuary we resumed our european stair climbing tradition.  We first walked 257 stairs to the whispering gallery.  This is a cool balcony where you can face the wall and whisper.  The person standing directly opposite you across the circle, over 100 feet away, can hear you perfectly clearly.  I'd like to explain the physics of this but I'm told that my readership will decline if I include any equations.  I guess all three of you are safe and will remain loyal readers.  After the whispering gallery we continued another 266 stairs up to the gold gallery.  From here we had a very good, but slightly foggy view of all of London.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we walked across the Millennium bridge and toured Shakespeare's Globe theater.  This is a slightly modernized version of the original, but still true to the spirit of performing plays in daylight where the actors and audience are face to face.  It would have been really fun to try to watch a show there, but Macbeth is being performed at the moment and it seemed a bit dark, and long given our schedule for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we are chilling at our hotel, the Luna Simone, watching Mexico and South Africa play futbol.  South Africa just scored and are up one nil.  Very exciting for the South African side.  We have been researching whether or not we dare show the american colors during the game tomorrow.  Research has indicated that the scottish people will cheer for ANY opponent of England, so we feel pretty comfortable about watching the game in a pub in Ediburgh tomorrow.  Maybe some nice scottish people will buy us a pint if we win!   (darn, Mexico just scored)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaia is waiting patiently for her phone call from her Concordia advisor to do her registration!  Then we'll grab a quick dinner and head out to see Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace Theater.  We had three shows that we wanted to see while we were in London and this one won out since we walked right by the box office last night.  We also wanted to see Stomp, and We Will Rock You. Yes, a Queen musical, featuring Bohemian Rhapsody and of course We Will Rock You.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=London,%20England&amp;z=10'&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3408176807179586741?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>oxford, windsor and london</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/oxford-windsor-and-london.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-11:/PelicanBlog/oxford-windsor-and-london.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I already posted about today's adventures I guess this is a catchup posting about yesterday.

We started our day with a quick trip in to Oxford.  We drove around the University area, and found the varsity shop so we could get the requisite sweatshirts.  We also found a Starbucks for a quick breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Oxford we headed to Windsor Castle.  Nothing can prepare you for the first view of Windsor from the distance.  It is the most imposing, amazing castle you have ever seen.  Josh and I said that if we were an invading army and saw that castle from a distance we would simply turn our horses around and ride home.  "Run away, Run away..." in your best Monty Python voice. It just looks like every castle you have ever imagined.  Here's josh standing below one of the towers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/1063.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/s_1063.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour of the inside of the castle included the living quarters, as well as St. Georges Chapel.  St. Georges is where the Queen knights the new Knights. The living quarters were, of course, amazing, and large, but the scale on the inside just did not compare to the outside view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Windsor we returned our car to Hertz and then we were supposed to meet a car we had pre-arranged with Simply Airports.  After waiting 15 minutes we called.  Yes, the driver is there, in a blue Chrysler, he is looking for you.  Can he call you on this cell phone number?  Of course, but no call.  Another 15 minutes and we determined that although the driver had not been able to call us on our european cell phone, he was at the wrong Hertz.  He was at the airport counter not at their drop off location near the airport.  He'll be right there.  Oh wait, where is it?  How does he get there?  How does he get here?  Dude, follow the signs to rental car return and come on in to Hertz.   15 minutes later still no sign of the driver.  Time for "Plan B"  We hop on the Hertz shuttle to head back to the airport and take the train to downtown.  As we leave Hertz we see a Blue Chrysler mini-van making a u-turn and heading back down the road the wrong way.  Really?  Was this guy actually waiting for us to come out the Hertz exit rather than driving in?  I guess we'll never know.  But in the meantime, I would not recommend booking a car with Simply Airports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we got to our hotel, we were all tired, hungry, and a little bit grumpy, but we decided to press on.  We walked back up to Victoria Station,  Then to BUCKingham Palace, through the park, on to Trafalger Square, and finally to Parliament.  The parliament building is also massive and old.  Mike if you are reading here's some Timber frame porn for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/1064.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/s_1064.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hall was probably two football fields long!  Look at all of that English Oak!  We were also able to see the house of commons in session.  We saw several ministers arguing about poverty in great britain, along with several people in traditional wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We completed our day by finishing our circle tour, walking back toward Victoria Station.  We decided to have dinner at L'Arco Italian restaurant, right around the corner from the theater where Billy Elliot is playing.  It was a small family run establishment, and the food was really good.  I had a tomato based Risotto and some Veal Marsala.  Jane had the Risotto too, Kaia had some delicious pesto gnocchi, and josh pizza marguerita of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-629658427605568001?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>bath to oxford</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/bath-to-oxford.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-10:/PelicanBlog/bath-to-oxford.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you remember Sir John Gielgud  from the movie Arthur?

Imagine the most proper british gentleman you can, and you will have our guide for the tour of Blenheim Palace we had today.  This guy was much shorter than Sir Gielgud but he was a pretty good guide.  He told us about fine china and tapestries the architects of the Palace along with many of the priceless artifacts that have been collected by the Spencer Churchill family over the years.  As we finished each room of the palace our guide would say very politely, well if there are no questions I think that just covers it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our tour with Jeeves, we decided to see the Untold Story of Blenheim.  This is part Disney animatronics and part history lesson.  All in all it did not work for us.  The animated dummies they had playing the parts of members of the royal households were all placed in front of 'mirrors' which were really computer screens, so although we looked at the dummy's back we saw a real person's face projected on the screen as if it was a reflection.  These characters tried to tell us the back story behind how the Palace was constructed.  One can only take so much royal sex scandal before it gets old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/1492.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/s_1492.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blenheim Palace is the home of the family of the Duke of Marlborough, although once a year they have to send a flag to BUCKingham, yes you must say that with a British accent with all of the emphasis on the BUCK and you will have it just about right.  The purpose of the flags is to avoid paying what must be an incredible amount of rent.  As long as the flag is delivered on time the family gets another year rent free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blenheim was actually our second castle of the day today.  We started the morning by visiting Sudeley castle in the Cotswolds.  This is one of the castles where Henry VIII and his wives hung out.  Much of the castle is in ruins now, but it really is interesting, especially after watching several episodes of The Tudors on HBO.  Other highlights of Sudeley were the Gardens and the Peacocks that were running around and in captivity in the Pheasantry.  Yes, how many of  you have been to a Pheasantry??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/1493.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/s_1493.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch today was at Noel Arms in Chipping Camden.  Jane had a Ploughman's lunch, Josh had ice cream, and Kaia and I tried a burger.  It was a nice English pub and we had to try some of the local brews, also quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stayed in Woodstock at The Bear, It is a hotel in a building that was built in the late 1600's!  The rooms are everywhere with no two alike.  While Kaia went for a run I had a real english G&amp;amp;T although I really did not appreciate the use of the slice of cucumber in place of the lime.  Dinner was at a small family run italian restaurant (Branca) across the street from the hotel.  I had a great bolognese, Jane had Arrabiata, and Josh and Kaia had Pizza.  All in all this was a great birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Woodstock,%20England&amp;z=10'&gt;Woodstock, England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-554403121483725046?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>a clean sweep of bath</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/a-clean-sweep-of-bath.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-08:/PelicanBlog/a-clean-sweep-of-bath.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we flew from Chicago to London.

We tried a day flight instead of an overnight flight and it worked very well.  We left Chicago at 9:05AM and arrived at Heathrow at 10:30PM.  The flight was very easy an non-eventful, it worked perfect for someone who cannot fall asleep on an airplane.  We got into Heathrow and did the customs thing and by the time we got to our hotel it was after midnight.  To our bodies it was still early evening but by 1:30 we all had lights out and were working on sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did sleep in until 8:45 this morning.  From there we took off for Bath by way of Stonehenge.  For those of you who don't know, Stonehenge is a big circle of rocks.  Merlin the magician moved them down from Ireland sometime in the distant past.  This was well before King Uther died, because he is apparently buried in Stonehenge.  Here's Kaia and Josh at Stonehenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1857.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1857.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At lunchtime we at at a local establishment called Jacqueline's Bistro.  Jane and Kaia had fresh baked baguettes with goat cheese, Josh had a ham and cheese omelet with salad and I had fish and chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we moved on to our final destination for today, Bath.  When you arrive in downtown Bath you are "in a twisty turny maze"  Its hard to know where you are, and the gps was equally unenlightened at several points.  When we finally did find the parking lot where we were supposed to leave our car, it was closed for re-surfacing!  So we had to go back to find a different lot that we had passed along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After parking the car it was a very short walk to our Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast at Three Abbey Green. We have a beautiful two room suite, so we have to room to spread out tonight.  Josh and Kaia both have their own beds and Kaia gets a separate bedroom.  Breakfast is included as part of the deal in the morning.  Here's a nice view of the courtyard and our place for the night.  The entrance is to the left of the giant tree in this photo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1858.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1858.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went out to view the sites of Bath, its a great downtown area once you are on foot.  We visited the Roman Baths - from whence Bath got its name  - and looked at the Abbey.  Went shopping to replace the shorts that I left hanging on the back of the bathroom door at the Super 8 in Chicago.  On the recommendation of our hotelier we went to the Eye of India for some great Indian food for dinner.  We had Tikki Takka Tak, (I'm not making that up) Garlic Chili Masala, and Chicken Khorma, along with rice and nan.  Here's Kaia and Jane at the Baths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1859.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1859.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight of the day was definitely the after dinner show, called Bazaar Bath.  Its a comedy/magic show that roams around downtown.  The host entertains by poking fun of the people on the tour and doing tricks.  As advertised, you do not learn anything about the history or culture of Bath, but it is a lot of laughs and I highly recommend this show if you come to Bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately our string of injuries continues  as Jane seems to have slipped a disc as we were walking around for the show tonight.  Hopefully ibuprofen and heat will have her back as good as new in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bath,%20England&amp;z=10'&gt;Bath, England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8985996883290673845?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>off to a fast start</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/off-to-a-fast-start.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-06-08:/PelicanBlog/off-to-a-fast-start.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the Super 8 in Elk Grove IL, our plane leaves at 9:05 tomorrow morning.

This is a new experiment for us, as usually flights to europe are overnight flights.  This one will put us in London at 10:45 PM.  We are hopeful that this will alleviate the jet lag on the first day.  Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to report today except that I put a big gash in the top of my head before we even left the house today.  I was out scooping poop in the back yard so Josh could mow before we left.  As I was walking up the yard focusing on scanning the ground ahead of me I ran smack into a low hanging branch of the Oak tree.  I immediately put my hand to my head and it came away full of blood.  Head wounds really do bleed a lot.  After determining I would not need stitches Jane put some neosporin on the cut and that was that.  My scalp itches and my head still hurts a bit.  I think cutting off that limb will be a high priority project when we get back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We drove to chicago by way of Madison and stopped to have supper with Holly and Madeline at the Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant.  I had the caribbean jerk sauce which I thought was quite good.  Not anywhere near as spicy as my burrito from Panchero's yesterday.  If you guys at Panchero's down in Ankeney are reading this, I would just say you do not need to use a whole scoop of your hottest sauce in your burrito, particularly since you have become so stingy with your sour cream.  This is the first thing in my life that I have not been able to eat because it was too spicy.  I might also just add that this extreme amount of heat was not just my own tender palate, but was confirmed by He-man Joel Martin, who reportedly lives off Panchero's at law school.  He had thoughtfully offered to finish my burrito for me, but was similarly stymied by the extreme heat.  All of this just serves to remind me that I am looking forward to some good Indian food once we get to England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6941766327029827348?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>testing</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/testing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2010-05-20:/PelicanBlog/testing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the big upcoming trip to Europe I wanted to try out a couple of blogging apps for my iPad.

One of the activities that Jane had researched before the cruise is called the Chef's table.  This is a really exclusive experience that they only do once a cruise for a very limited number of people.  In our case there were ten of us lucky passengers that called toget our name on the list as soon as we got on the ship.  Of the ten all of us were experienced multi-cruise passengers.  A couple of Florida cruises 3 times a year.  Another couple from Ohio had cruised many times with their family.  They were a bit older than us as their kids were out of college by now.  The two other couples were both gay men.  Ha, no stereotypes here that a foodie event should have four gay men in attendance!  One couple was from LA and the other from New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all met at the International cafe for a short pre-dinner briefing.  We met the Executive Chef who was our tour guide for the galley and the rest of the evening.  The chef directs a staff of around 250 spread throughout seven galleys on the ship.  We began our tour of the galley that served our dining room by putting on our white FDA inspector lab coats.  As the tour was happening during dinner service we had to wash our hands wear the lab coats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chef was really friendly and very willing to answer any of our questions.  We told him how much we liked the parmesan crust under the fettucine alfredo and he launched into a very detailed explanation of how they made the crusts each day.  I got the whole thing on video with our little video toy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the galley tour we gathered in an out of the way corner and had hors-de-ouveres and champagne.  We started out with a sashimi tuna with wasabi sauce, served on a little scoop made of a fennel root.  This was followed by:  a delicious pate, vegetarian quiche, Escargot, and caviar served on a little potato pancake.  Yes I ate everything including the caviar which was really very good served on the potato pancake with a little sour cream.  As he introduced each appetizer we got a summary of how it was prepared.  It was really interesting.  None of the appetizers or anything in our meal is available anywhere else on the ship.  It is a meal that is totally unique to the Chefs Table dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the appetizers we made our way through the dining room to a special table.  As we walked through the dining room everyone applauded the chef and many applauded us as well having no idea that we were just on a special tour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we were in the kitchen we were promised a lobster risotto and some "special surprises"  We began with another little appetizer and some Pouilly Fume.  The latest appetizer was beef carpacio on foccacia.  The carpacio was layered with alternating layers of parmesan cheese and arugula.  It was good but too much considering everything else we knew was coming.   Next was the Lobster Risotto.  This was probably the best Risotto I've ever had in a restaurant.  (except maybe that one exceptional night at LaRanna where I had the Asiago cheese risotto with cauliflower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now of course our pallets were in real need of cleansing.  So the maitre de brought out a round of lemon sorbet.  Of course sorbet alone would not work as well as sorbet with Grey Goose vodka poured over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With clean pallets we finally moved to the main course.  Potatos gratin with lobster, veal, and tornados of beef.  Plus some veggies thrown in for good measure.  I can only describe this course as a cruise size portion.  Each person had their own platter full of meat, potatos and veggies.  Everything was just great.  At this point we switched to a Wolf-Blass Shiraz to accompany the main course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the main course was done we moved on to the cheese course.  Roquefort balls and a bridge of parmesan cheese.  This was not my favorite course as the roquefort was really strong, and the parmesan bridge was 'more 'structural than edilble' in the words of one of our dinner companions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next course was the true dessert course, presented by the ships pastry chef.  He had constructed a really nice Amaretto desert plate for us which was really a sculpture on a plate.   Desert was served with a delicious desert wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next we had our espresso or capucino served with some home made chocolates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grand finale was nice glass of limoncello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the meal was over the maitre de and photographer showed up.  Each couple got their picture taken with the chef and staff, and each 'lady' recieved a cookbook.  Notably the gay couples did not receive any cookbooks!  This was rectified after one of the guys took the maitre de aside and explained that it probably wasn't fair for them to be excluded from the cookbook.  Since they paid the same as us and probably cooked just as much as the rest of us.  One of the guys was a professor at Loyala Marymount in LA and he and I talked a little college shop during the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of the other guys found out I was leading a J-term trip to Silicon Valley during January he volunteered to connect me with a friend of his that works at Pixar!  Wow that would be an awesome dinner result if we are able to get a tour at Pixar.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2280866958049381492?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>airboat ride in the everglades</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/airboat-ride-in-the-everglades.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-12-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2009-12-27:/PelicanBlog/airboat-ride-in-the-everglades.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning started out like any other morning.

The alarm went off at 6:15 so that we could get up and get on our way to the everglades.  We left the Embassy Suites and walked down 17th Avenue toward the intercostal waterway where we were picking up our rental car.  On the way we split our forces with half of us going to Einstein's Bagel Shop and half to Starbucks for Tea, Chai Latte and Cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We beat the traffic heading out of town easily on our way to the Sawgrass recreation park.  It is part of the Everglades national park.  We had an appointment with Captain Randy and his airboat at 8:00.  Our instructions were to meet him 1/2 mile past mile marker 38 on highway 27.  We got there early, the sun was still pretty low in the sky and finished our breakfast in the small parking lot.  A few minutes later a pickup truck pulling an airboat with seating for nine pulled into the lot.  We watched as the captain fired up the 500 horsepower Corvette engine hooked up to a four blade airline propellor.  After the short checkout period he backed the boat and trailor into the water and brought the boat around to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We greeted Captain Randy, who showed us onto the boat and gave us a short intro to our safety equipment, which consisted of headphones to protect our eardrums from the sound of the engine and airplane prop.  He invited one of us to join him in the topmost pair of seats as the co-pilot.  We took off, and after a short lesson in steering the airboat, push forward for right and pull back for left, he turned the steering over to me.  Driving an airboat takes a lot more anticipation than driving a ski boat.  When you want to turn a corner on one of the trails in the everglades you need to start doing so a few seconds in advance.  Luckily if you cut the corner to sharp, or too late you really don't run into any problems.  You make the trail a little wider as you mow down the Sawgrass and cattail, but there seems to be enough of both to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the early morning trip was a great idea as the angle of the sun was just beautiful, and we saw hundreds of birds as we cruised through the trails.  We saw hawks, and herons, and vultures and birds of all different colors and varieties.   In addition to the birds we were always on the lookout for gators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Randy seems to have come from a long line of Everglades boat captains that have been involved with all kinds of dubious activities.  Pappy was an alligator poacher, and Randy and his brother kept small alligators as pets when they were younger.  As Captain Randy fed one of the gators along the way hotdogs and marshmallows he informed us that feeding the gators was strictly against the law.  That didn't stop him, and we got some great pictures of Randy feeding his Mi Amoure Catalyna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after our gator feeding experience, we reached the farthest point on our tour.  By this point we were all pretty comfortable with the boat and so I was sitting in the bow taking pictures and the rest of the family was comfortably spread around.  Randy headed the boat down a narrow trail and suddenly I noticed that we were boating in mud instead of water.  As the mud got thicker and drier the boat went slower and slower until we finally came to a halt.  Stuck in the mud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to gun the giant engine on our airboat for many minutes Randy finally admitted that we were stuck and going to need some help getting out.  At this point we learned a couple of things about Randy's friend Lyle.  First, Lyle had an extremely long message on his business phone, and his cell phone.  Second we learned that Randy had helped Lyle out of a similar situation just a couple of days ago.  After failing to reach Lyle by phone we resorted to the old fashioned VHF radio.  "Laxahatchie, Laxahatcie, Laxahatchie, Lyle this is Randy are you there, over...."  With those words our 3-hour tour became a rescue mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our airboat was partway down a trail that had been drained of water.  We were about 150 feet onto the mud and it looked like the mud continued for another 300 before it rounded a bend.  The trick was to turn the airboat around and pull it out the short way.  Unfortunately in the Everglades walking on mud is not so easy.  When Randy got out of the boat to try and use a rope to turn us around he sunk up nearly to his waist.  To get back to the edge of the water required him to crawl on hands and knees to distribute his weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four of us stayed in the boat feeling somewhat amused at our situation.  Clearly we were not in any sort of life threatening emergency but for Randy this was clearly a pain in the butt and probably somewhat of an embarrasment.  We were not dressed to jump in the mud and help him, although Kaia seemed very willing to do so.  Josh was protecting his new green and white Nikes that Grandpa Miller bought him for Christmas but other than that I think he would have helped too.   I had on a brand new pair of Tommy Bahama shorts that I was definitely not interested in getting covered in Everglades mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rescuue mission was long and tedious as Lyle's big boat could not turn around at the end of our trail.  This required the help of a third airboat driven by a kind stranger.  The third boat acted as  a tug boat getting Lyle in the proper position and ferrying the rope into Randy when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The procedure that Randy and Lyle determined for getting us out involved tieing a line to the bow of the boat and then pulling with Lyle's larger airboat.  To a physicist this seemed like a dumb idea as the angles involved were all wrong, but neither Randy or Lyle were physicists so this was not an issue.  After breaking Randy's bowline there was some thought that the way to resolve the issue would be to bring a couple of pieces of plywood so that the tourists would be able to walk out of the trail but going from plank to plank and moving the planks as we made progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking the tourists out was not an acceptable plan to Captain Randy.   It was clear that Lyle's larger rope needed to be connected directly to the bow of our airboat and then threaded through the side of the boat about halfway back.  Randy decided that he would get to the side with a second rope and pull to try and provide the needed force vector to get the boat to turn to the side.  After several long pulls we finally had the boat turned at a ninty degree angle to our original course.  (This only took about three hours to get us to this position).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We repositioned the rope to the bow of Randy's ship and he got in his captains chair.  At this point the plan was to have one last pull by Lyle with Randy ready to "Give her Hell" as soon as we were headed in roughly the right direction.  With this plan in mind and one last pull we were finally free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once free of the mud we followed Lyle back to his docking area where hugs were exchanged and many thumbs up were given to our kind helpers.   By this time Captain Randy had completely missed his 11:30 trip and was wanting to make sure we got back to the landing in time to meet his 2:30.  So we took off for home base at high speed.  After a while he slowed down so that Jane or Josh could drive.  Josh wanted to have nothing to do with driving as by this time he was convinced that he would do something even worse than get us stuck in the mud.  So Jane took her turn and did a great job of driving the boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before we got back to the landing we made one last stop with captain Randy to make sure that we had our stories straight.  Clearly he was a little nervous that his muddy appearance might be offputting to his next group.  Particularly if we were unhappy and complaining about the trip.  He really had no reason to worry, all of us thought the trip was a great adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our exciting airboat trip we planned to stop at the Sawgrass Mill, an enormous shopping center.  It took us almost a half hour of driving around to find the Ron Jon outlet store.  Even after we found it it took forever to get in because the parking lot was so busy and full.  The plan was for us to stop there to get Kaia a swimming suit.  Since I had discovered that my old suit was too big for me I decided to get one too.  Josh also found himself a nice suit and a football for using in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next big surprise of the night came when we walked over to Pazzo's for an italian dinner.  We walked in the door and talked to the hostess who told us to wait just a minute as she checked the tables.  As we stood waiting for a minute a familiar figure came across the bar headed toward us.  Sasan Mokhtari and his family were in the restaurant!  they were in town for the soccer tournament.  It was really fun to reconnect with Sasan after several years.  We had a great talk with Sasan and Mary and their kids Tara, Eva, and Daniel.  Tara is a first year at MIT and Eva and Daniel have transferred to Breck.   It took Sasan only about 3 minutes to ask me if I would be interested in doing some consulting for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a great meal, although Josh was feeling a little sick and didn't eat very much.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7763680025059074412?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>3 days of r&amp;r in sedona</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/3-days-of-r-r-in-sedona.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2009-06-06:/PelicanBlog/3-days-of-r-r-in-sedona.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After all of our hiking and rafting adventure we are ending the trip with 3 days of rest and relaxation in Sedona.

Our major activities here are a Pink Jeep tour, Golfing, and a massage for the women in the family.  Otherwise we are doing lots of pool time and have even played a hand or two of 500.  Sedona is known for its red rock and beautiful scenery, along with crystal shops and the Ye Olde UFO Shoppe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq8nbha5xI/AAAAAAAAAFM/7G1088HYM5k/IMG_8141.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8141.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did the Broken Arrow tour with Pink Jeep, which was fun.  I think we would have appreciated it even more if we had not already done all the hiking through Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon.   Nevertheless it was a good excursion.  While we were out there the kids decided to do some rock climbing.  Don't let the pictures fool you this was dangerous stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq9EcmQuZI/AAAAAAAAAFU/OQaWwLBIbPc/IMG_8147.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8147.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq9a6hsYfI/AAAAAAAAAFY/I2n5d7fJrVE/IMG_8151.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8151.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning Josh and I played a round of golf at the Sedona Country Club which is part of the Hilton complex.  It was a very nice course and Josh and I both played well.  It was a great morning to go as there was nobody in front of us and we were able to play at our own pace and move around the course pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh got a new shirt and hat out of the deal as the club had a dress code and Josh did not have any clean shirts that would get him on the tee.  I played so well that I had to buy a new shirt to commemorate the occasion.  It was 25% off for fathers day so happy fathers day to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane and Kaia both had facials and hot stone massages.  I can't go into any more detail about that. :-)  But they were both glowing and relaxed when they got back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we are going to go out for some barbeque and then come back to the room and get packed for the final leg of our journey.

It was already twilight in the East and it was time to pack up camp and get on the rafts for the final 3/4 mile of our journey.  We had all come a long way on this trip.  From the first night where everyone managed to find a place to sleep in private, this last night looked like a refugee camp.  We didn't have much room and everyone slept right next to everyone else.  Here you can see everyone's gear and a corner of what we at first called the "Miller plot" and then renamed to Miller Estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigTrq6d5DI/AAAAAAAAAEw/TOHf4QJo2aw/IMG_8125.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8125.JPG" border="0" width="400"  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you can see the bridge that connects the Kaibab trail from the North to the South wall.  We went a little further downstream to Phantom Ranch and crossed our own bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigU1iMArfI/AAAAAAAAAE0/uWG6QyTQ1fw/P5310154.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5310154.JPG" border="0" width="400"  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facts of the Phantom Ranch trail are as follows:  Its a 10 mile hike from the river to the rim.  It is a 1 mile vertical difference from the river to the rim.  Now the mathematically inclined will say that is only a 10% grade.  Not a problem...  It was a challenge.  They tell you to have two one liter water bottles and to fill them full at the bottom.  there is a halfway stop called Indian Gardens with a water station and a 3 mile (from the top) stop with a water station and a 1.5 mile stop with a water station.  We filled our water at every stop.  You do drink a LOT of water on this hike.  You are also advised to rest for 30 minutes at each stop if you are having difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the river at 7AM and were to Indian Gardens by 10:30.  This is going well we thought.  Unfortunately when you get to Indian Gardens you have only gone 1/4 of the vertical distance.  We finally arrived at the rim at 3:30.  We made a lot of extra stops on the last half of the hike.  Jane did not drink enough water during the first half and was struggling a bit during the second part of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigW1AjmoOI/AAAAAAAAAE8/mM2EkeXu1AE/P6010159.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P6010159.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact with half a mile remaining she was completely pooped.  We asked one of our fellow hikers to send Josh back to carry Jane's pack the last half mile.  Josh wins the good sport award for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigXXjlwX7I/AAAAAAAAAFA/32-a0vXTKC4/P6010162.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P6010162.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you might wonder is the hike worth it for all that work?  Yes, absolutely you get to see the Canyon in a way that you just can't imagine by looking down from the rim.  Here you can see some of the trail we came up.  But not all the way to the river that is hidden in the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigYdfxl7rI/AAAAAAAAAFI/San87ACclXw/P6010161.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P6010161.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures don't do justice to the amazing beauty of this corner of the world.  We are all really glad we did this trip.  As I'm writing this from the comfort of the Sedona Hilton, I'm inspired by the message on my plastic Gin and Tonic glass which says that "Travel is not about getting from point A to B, Travel should renew your zest for life."  This trip has certainly done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4275575022097608940?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>down the colorado into the canyon</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/down-the-colorado-into-the-canyon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2009-06-02:/PelicanBlog/down-the-colorado-into-the-canyon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For three days we had a great raft trip with Wilderness River Adventures.

The trip was amazing!  For three days we saw the Grand Canyon in a way that few are lucky enough to see, from the bottom up.  As we rafted along we literally saw the history of the world from today to 2 billion years ago.  The beauty of this place is just awe inspiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We began our trip at Lee's Ferry, just south of Page Arizona and ended up at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  We shared the trip with another small group (Rocky, Joe, and Denise) and one large group from Lafayette College.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lafeyette group really made the trip for us.  The group of Geology students was led by Dr. Larry Malinconico (Dr. M) and Dr. Dave Sunderlin.  In my slightly biased opinion I thought that Luther students were the friendliest students anywhere.  The group from Lafeyette taught me that there are other colleges with really great students.  Not only did we learn a lot from lurking in the back of the impromptu lectures but we had a great time getting to know them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a couple of examples of how beautiful the canyon is.  Here we are in calm water:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUx345cH9I/AAAAAAAAAEQ/YZlnVnlMQ5U/P5300099.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5300099.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here was one of our short day hikes.  You can see our rafts to the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUyPaMcXYI/AAAAAAAAAEY/F1mBn4QX7Gc/P5290087.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5290087.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course no rafting trip would be complete without the opportunity to get wet, which we are about to do here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUy6OwIiKI/AAAAAAAAAEc/XfXxVO3Vf-A/P5310138.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5310138.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no trip report from me would be complete without a review of the food.  In a word, awesome.  Here are the two swampers (Kari and Everett) preparing our last dinner.  Spaghetti and meatballs, or Alfredo Sauce.  We had Salmon and rice one night, grilled New York Strips and Baby Red Potatoes another night.  It was all "good eats".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUzrmaaTLI/AAAAAAAAAEk/2sppXUAn_08/IMG_8120.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8120.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaders of the trip were Richard and Matt. Two excellent raft drivers.  Not sure what the proper term is for the captain of a giant rubber raft.  But they got us safely through some really "fun" rapids.  At one point the Miller family did experience a collective flashback to being stranded in the Everglades when our raft got hung up on Whale Rock.  This was right in the middle of the biggest rapids of the trip and we were just starting to wonder how we were going to get rescued when the raft freed itself and we were on our way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleeping accomodations were better than expected by my standards.  For three nights we just slept on our mats under the stars.  No tents, just sleeping bags, tarps and mats.  It was great.  Since Arizona does not observe daylight savings time, it was dark by 8:30PM and light by 5:00 AM.  So it was an early to bed early to rise kind of trip.  One night I woke up at midnight and got out the camera.  This picture doesn't really do justice to the beauty of the night sky in Arizona but it gives you some idea of what we saw from our sleeping bags:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiU1KuxAHCI/AAAAAAAAAEo/z07SysNr32o/IMG_8061.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8061.JPG" border="0" width="400"  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last day of our trip we got up at 4:30AM and went about half a mile downstream to Phantom Ranch.  From there we hiked 10 miles linearly and 1 mile vertically to get out of the Grand Canyon.  I'll cover that experience in another post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4386983974210771226?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>bryce canyon sunrise -- antelope canyon</title><link href="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/bryce-canyon-sunrise-antelope-canyon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-05-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brad Miller</name></author><id>tag:bnmnetp.github.io,2009-05-29:/PelicanBlog/bryce-canyon-sunrise-antelope-canyon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was an early morning today.

We made a short drive up to Bryce Point in twilight.  The temperature was only 37 degrees but it did not seem too cold.  We waited a few minutes for the sun to come up over the distant horizon.  When it did we were rewarded with some amazing colors in the canyon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh9jBITqVyI/AAAAAAAAAEE/J6SXXOYQ4aY/IMG_7744.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7744.JPG" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sunrise we had breakfast at the hotel and then headed south toward Page.  We had a slot canyon tour booked for 10:30 Arizona time so we thought we had plenty of time.  Unfortunately we ran into an accident that closed highway 89.  We had a nice chat with an over-the-road truck driver as we waited for the ambulance and fire crew to clear the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We still made it in time for our Antelope Canyon tour.  This was an amazing photographic experience.  I took way to many pictures but I'm going to have a hard time picking out 10 favorites from the 200 I took.  Here's one as a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh9kduy0QNI/AAAAAAAAAEM/oaSkp66UXFg/IMG_7879.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7879.jpg" border="0" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After checking out the view of the Colorado River we relaxed at the hotel around the pool.  We just got back from our orientation meeting tonight.  We got our waterproof bags to pack all our luggage in.  We are all looking forward to the raft trip starting at 8:15 tomorrow morning.

Left Minneapolis at 9:05 this morning and just got into our room in Springdale UT at 11:00 Mountain time, or midnight back home.  Actually we checked in a while ago but went straight to the Bit and Spur to have some dinner since our last meal was at Schlotzky's in Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GPS said it would be a 7 hour drive.  it turned out to be longer than that because we took a side trip to the Desert View overlook in the Grand Canyon.  Here is a view from the Desert View of the Colorado River.  We'll be rafting down that river and into the canyon in just a few days.  We will be able to see the watchtower from the river on our way into the canyon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sht35AvBjnI/AAAAAAAAADM/5LwsSq8GlS0/IMG_7394.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7394.JPG" border="0" width="800"  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was still quite a drive from the Grand Canyon to Springdale UT.

We had ordered a cab the night before so it was waiting for us right at 7:30.  We arrived at the airport in plenty of time and got our first taste of how they allocate checkin space in a european airport.  The trick is that all the checkin desks are common and the airlines are just assigned a desk or two for their flights for the day.  After some looking we finally figured this out and found a display board that told us the number of the desk that Brussels Airline was working from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial difficulties with their computers we finally moved to a new desk and got checked in.  Three security checkpoints later we were waiting at our gate for our flight to be called.  The Brussels Air plane was an old 737 that was a 3 and 3 configuration with about 6 inches of legroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the Brussels airport and were reminded how nice and new and clean it seems.  After all the initial security in rome we were surprised that we did not need to go through customs or passport control after arriving in Brussels. In order to get our luggage we had to walk a very long way, after getting our luggage it was a very short walk to the hotel shuttles and our holiday inn van had just arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holiday Inn was quite nice.  The lobby was clean and nice and they had Internet!  We were initially disappointed with our non-smoking room that smelled like an all night poker game had just wrapped up, but after opening the window and putting the air conditioner on vent it didn't take very long to get things aired out to the point where it was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the swimming pool the pool area also had a hot tub.  This was a great way to relax a bit and any thoughts of catching a train to downtown for more site seeing vanished.  We ate at the hotel bar for supper as we didn't really feel like paying 40 euros for the evening buffet.  Josh and I had a bacon cheeseburger, Kaia had pureed vegetable soup and pasta, Jane had shrimp skewers.  The kids were very excited because they could get chocolate milk!  Their first milk in many days.  Jane and I had draft beers of the local Leffe variety.  I had 'Leffe brune' and Jane had 'Leffe Blonde.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we retired to the room for a final night of 500.  Josh and I were victorious again!  We won two games quite convincingly with Josh carrying me on his back most of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Things we learned today:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christmas and the Saturnalia.  At the temple of Saturn we learned that christmas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spaghetti Westerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Clemente&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Lorenzo (patron saint of cooks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The founding of Rome and the vestal virgins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story of San Sebastian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our long day of touring we finally walked next door to the hotel to see the pantheon.  It was cool but after a full day of interesting stories and explanations from tony it was a bit of a letdown.  Kaia really wanted to visit some of the exclusive shops along the street near the Spanish Steps.  We had also decided that Kaia needed something to replace the green duffle that had been causing troubles the whole trip.  So we found a relatively inexpensive piece that was larger than her carryon size at a shop along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh and I were charged with bringing the luggage back to the hotel while Jane and Kaia continued on their shopping quest.  I told Jane to buy me a new pen at the Mont Blanc store, but with prices starting at over 300 euros she and Kaia were too intimidated to even go in the store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our day of touring and shopping we headed for our dinner reservation at Alfredos Originale.  The home of Fettucine Alfredo!  Kaia was so excited she could hardly stand it, for her it was like a religious pilgrimage.  I was also excited to see how my recipe compared with Alfredo's.  Alfredo's was good but very different from mine.  It was very light on the cream, but heavier on the butter and Parmiagano Reggiano.&lt;/p&gt;

We decided that would be the easiest place to do an audio tour to get the most out of the day without a guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving the hotel we asked the concierge for dinner recommendations for someplace indian or Thai.  We are so burned out on pasta that we are delaying our long anticipated trip to Alfredo's (home of fettucine alfredo) until tomorrow night.  We have a recommendation for an Indian restaurant called Maharajah.  The concierge will make reservations while we are touring today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vatican and St. Peters are within pretty easy walking distance of our hotel so we have a quick breakfast in the hotel breakfast salon and then head out.  Even though it is just 9:00 the crowds are 2/3 of the way around the outer ring of statues at St. Peters when we get there.  Not being very prepared we just get in back of the line and prepare ourselves for a wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 2 minutes in line we hear an english voice asking people near us if they would like to avoid the long lines and get a tour of the vatican in english.  The 10:00 tour is just starting he said. We knew this was a bit of a risk, but since we had already committed to pay for a guide today we figured this would be better than standing in line all day and trying to follow an audio tour through the vatican museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be a reasonably good decision.  Our guide was a young women from Canada named Sandra who graduated with an art history degree from Queens college in Canada.  The tour only cost 13 euros per person plus entry into the museum.  In the end Josh did not cost anything and kaia was reduced price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the tour in front of the Obelisk in St. Peters square.  This obelisk came from Egypt as a gift many years ago.  The egyptions asked for it back and rome refused.  Unfortunately the the obelisk was not centered properly in front of St. Peters and so the pope decided it must be moved.  The obelisk weighed 300 metric tons and 500 romans showed up to help move the obelisk.  thousands of romans showed up to watch and the pope swore everyone to silence under pain of death so that the workmen could concentrate. (the only time that many romans have ever been quiet)  After they had moved the obelisk, but just as they were raising it into its new position the ropes started to fray.  everyone was absolutely silent until one man broke his vow to yell out that they should put water on the ropes to lubricate them.  This saved the day and the man was not beheaded but was given a yearly salary in gratitude from the pope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that short story we walked around and away from St. Peters to the American Bar where we paid our guide and she told us that once we had paid here she would go stand in the security line to hold our places for approximately 40 minutes, after which time we could join her in the line.  This was the point where more than one person in the group became a little suspicious that we might never find her in the line once we handed over the cash.  30 gullible tourists at 38 dollars a pop would be a pretty good mornings work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless Sandra was there in line or us 40 minutes later and even a bit longer than that as the security line was moving slowly this morning.  After getting into the museum we realized that the really long line we were in this morning was only for the free visit to St. Peters and we could have come over here ourselves.  Nevertheless Having Sandra as our guide turned out to be great.  We learned a lot from her about the things that we stopped to see.  She explained to us right away that this was just going to be the highlights and we would not stop to see everything.  In fact to see everything in the museum for 45 seconds would take 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pine cone garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the body statue -- inspiration for Rodin's The Thinker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nero's bathtub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rafael rooms - Michaelangelos rival that painted the scholars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sistine Chapel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we got out of the Sistine chapel it was 3:30 and our two hour tour had lasted four and a half hours.  We came right out of the chapel by the line to take the elevator up to the stairs leading up the cupola.  Another 320 stairs to climb to the very top.  the view from the top of St. Peter's was spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the climb and the view and the heat we were all more than a little dehydrated and hungry, luckily there was a (rather expensive) snack bar part of the way down.  we bought some pop and water and then took some pictures by the statues of the apostles.  when we got to the bottom of the stairs we came right out into the basilica so we looked around for a while but decided to pass on the trip through the crypt.  We headed back towards our hotel with the idea of getting a snack along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner tonight we had a reservation at Maharajah, an Indian Restaurant.  It was such a nice change of pace that everyone thought the food was delicious.  Josh and Kaia had Chicken Shahi Korma.  I had the Madras chicken curry.  I was going to order the vindaloo chicken again but the manager told me that vindaloo was the hottest, 80% chili peppers and 20% tomatoe.  The Madras was second hottest and was hot enough for me.  Jane had a dish caled 'Murg Peshwari' a Kashmiri style curry with oriental herbs, capsicum, onion and tomato.  Josh seemed to like that one even more than the chicken Korma.  We are making a curry lover out of him yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant was about a 20 minute walk from our hotel so we had time to stop for a gelato on the way home.  We had a chance to see the Tivoli fountain just as it was getting dark.  We were all very tired after a long hot day of walking so we were ready for bed by 10:00.&lt;/p&gt;

As we were eating breakfast we saw a cruise ship coming into the harboor.  it looked like they would be tendering directly into Sorrento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got up  early so we could meet our guide for a tour of Pompei.  We arrived at Pompei right at 8:30, purchased our tickets, and looked for our guide.  It turned out that we were looking for her in the wrong place.  She was at the Camping Zeus parking lot (where we parked) and we were at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guides name was Patricia (Pah Tree tsee aah).  She gave us a very good tour and turned out to be very quotable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moma Mia its hot!
Moma Mia we must get away from the enemy (the other tourists)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pompei was hot and busy even though we were some of the first people in line for tickets.  But it was still very interesting and a fun tour again.  It was even better after having read Harrison's book about Pompei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Highlights of Pompei&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the baths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;houses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour Patricia gave us a lunch recommendation for a restaurant right near the Cameo factory we had visited five years ago.  She introduced us as her friends to the Maitre De and told him to take good care of us.  We got off to a very good start when Jane asked for a Coke Light and he responded that they had Pepsi!  Our first Diet Pepsi in many days!  After that the rest of the lunch, Napoli style pizza was really irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked around a few of the shops and then headed for our car.  We knew we were a little ahead of schedule but there really was not time for any additional touring if we wanted to be in Rome by 5:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I had been able to follow the directions the guy at Renault gave me and programmed in the right location for the drop off.  It was in the same area as the airport but was next to a cow pasture!
The office seemed to be some kind of cheap warehouse space they had rented with a bit of covered parking for the returned vehicles.  After we inspected our car and signed over the lease the attendant drove us to the airport and dropped us off near the taxi line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed for the start of the taxi queue and were met by a driver who told us it would be 90 euros for a ride downtown for all four of us with our luggage.  That was much higher than we expected so we went inside to regroup and try to learn about the Rome shuttle service we had read about.  We finally gave up and decided to pay the 90 dollars to just get going.  On our way to the line we ran into a driver who told us he would take us for 65 euros.  He appeared to be wearing a taxi drivers license around his neck, but he took us to the parking lot rather than the taxi line.  We were really wondering if this guy was legit but he got us downtown in just 35 minutes for the agreed on price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hotel, Albergo Santa Chiara, is right behind the Pantheon.  When we checked in, the two managers were looking at us and their list of customers and speaking angrily as if to say 'what are we going to do with them?'  I think it worked in our favor as they gave us one of their three apartments.  We have a main room with TV and two pull out beds, a middle room with another bed, bathroom, and kitchen.  However the porter told us &amp;quot;chicken is locked.&amp;quot;  Finally, we have a master bedroom.  So we have a great room for our last three nights of touring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all agreed that we were really really tired of pasta and heavy italian food.  Unfortunately we did not have our Rick Steve's book nor had we asked at the front desk about alternative food sources.  So we settled for walking to Piazza Navonna to see what they had.  We found a restaurant that offered hamburgers and chicken along with traditional italian food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were sitting at our table waiting for service Kaia noticed a man drawing caricatures in the middle of the piazza.  She went to talk to the guy who told her he would draw both of them for 20 euros.  So, while we waited for our food Josh and Kaia each had a caricature drawn.  They are both very good.  Josh is a soccer player and Kaia is a runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we were seated on the outside table right next the the main traffic around the Piazza we were inundated with sales people trying to sell us flowers, and all kinds of glowing and buzzing things.  In addition we had fun watching the people selling scarves and fake Prada purses playing cat and mouse with the two police officers patrolling the piazza.  Everytime they would get their bags arranged on the side walk we would suddenly see a wave of them scooping up bags and heading down the sidewalk.  Followed by one of the officers.  As quickly as the officer passed they were back putting their wares down again.&lt;/p&gt;

We left Tuscany and headed all the way south bypassing Rome and Naples to Sorrento.  This is the small city that we stopped at on our cruise with Brian and Holly five years ago so we were excited to see the city again and try to find a few of the places we remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hotel, Settimo Cielo, was nice and clean but not spectacular.  The View from the deck off our hotel room WAS spectacular.  The hotel is built right into the side of the cliff overlooking the Bay of Naples.  Looking out at the ships and the lights along the bay was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel also had a small pool which gave the kids a chance to cool off and burn off some of the energy they had accumulated over the long drive from Tuscany.  They had the coolest lounge chairs by the pool.  Each chair had its own little adjustable sun shade built into it so if you wanted to read and shade your face you could flip it up and adjust it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we had rested up we walked into the shopping district in search of a nice bottle of Limoncello.  We actually found one in the shape of a cello and so we have that as a nice souvenir to bring home.  The streets were as narrow as I remembered, but were much more crowded than I remembered from a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought we had a good general idea of where the restaurant we had eaten at was but it took us a few false starts before we finally found the right place.  The restaurant is called La Lanterna and they seemed very happy that we had come back to have dinner with them again after five years.  The food was good, but not as good as our memories had created.  But we have had some exceptional meals on this trip and I think pasta burnout was starting to set in.  I had some really nice Cannelonni which could have and should have been enough.  Instead I had some Red Snapper for my secondi which was a bit on the tough and fishy side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we walked back to our hotel to get a good night sleep knowing that we had to get going early in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

A good day to hang around the apartment and do laundry.  Maybe today we actually had a chance to get everything to dry for us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing laundry and reading, I finished &lt;em&gt;Three Cups of Tea&lt;/em&gt; this morning, we headed in to Monteone for some lunch and hoping to find an internet point.   We arrived on an extremely slow day the weekly market was just closing down when we arrived but almost everything else in town was closed.  No internet point, not public library.  We had a small lunch at someplace fairly forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had one of the nicest dinners of the trip tonight at Casa Masi just down the road from Il Lebbio.  We definitely are getting the hang of european dinners and we had a little something from every course.  For our antipasti we had some bruschetti for primi I had pici pasta with a beautiful meat sauce, and kaia and josh had pici with a sheep cheese and basil.  Definitely worth trying to find some pici pasta to use at home!  For the Secondi We had steak, Jane and I both had fillet with a porcini mushroom on top.  Actually the mushroom was the only disappointment as it was a bit mushy.  For dolci Kaia and I had an amazingly rich chocolate cake, and josh had a fruit pudding.  I also ordered a little Grappa as a digestif.  We could have and should have walked home after dinner to work off the calories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight Josh and I finally recorded our first victory in 500!  After days of bad cards we were finally victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

The strike I am talking about is a gas strike.  Something I had never heard about before.  But had the effect of putting damper on what was otherwise an absolutely beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took off by 8:00 this morning toward Cinque Terre which is an italian national park consisting of 5 small villages along the Mediterranean.   To get there we drove two hours to La Spezia to take a short 10 minute train ride to Riomaggiore, the first of the cities.  As we got into La Spezia it started to rain.  We were also down to 1/8 of a tank of gas.  As we drove through town I noticed that all the gas stations were closed.  This was very curious to me until Jane said rather offhandedly 'they do have gas strikes in Italy occasionally.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual it was difficult to find parking around the train station, but after driving around for a while we found one relatively close.  We got our tickets and hopped the first train to Riomaggiore.  When we got there the clouds were at about 500 feet and we heard thunder.  In Riomaggiore you walk through a short tunnel and then take an elevator to the top of the town.  From the top there is a beautiful view of the ocean, mountains and vineyards surrounding this little town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan for the day was to hike the trails between the first 4 of the five cities and then take the train to the last city to avoid the most difficult part of the hike.  Unfortunately it started to POUR as we were walking down main street.  So, rather than stand in the middle of the road under our umbrellas we got a covered seat and bought some hot chocolate.  While sitting at the table we heard a couple of guys from Virginia talking.  They said they left Rome a day early to avoid the gas strike.  When I asked them about the strike they said 'didn't you hear!?'  'You can't buy any gas until tomorrow morning at 7AM.'  This didn't do my worry gene any good at all so we started looking into getting a hotel room right there in Riomaggiore.  No pajamas, no clean clothes, no toothbrush or anything.    A real adventure.  The first two places we checked were completely booked, but the third place had a small apartment available.  When I inquired about the gas strike she told me that stations on the autostrada and some 24 hour stations would be open after 7:00 that night.  So after some thought we decided to postpone our confirmation of the apartment.  We confirmed her information about the gas strike and availability of gas at the national park office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, feeling as relieved as I could in a country where we don't understand the news we set out on our hike in a very light drizzle.  The first part of the hike, between Riomaggiore and Manarola is a very easy and short walk on a well paved trail.  The best news was as we were hiking along we could see blue sky offshore headed our direction!  There was not much to see in Manarola so we continued our hike toward Corniglia.  This leg of the hike was only slightly more difficult and a little longer, until we arrived at the Corniglia train station.  To get from the train station to the main part of town you could either walk a winding road or take 500 stairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having hoped, but missing, the shuttle bus We opted for the road over the stairs.  At the top of the stairs we found the pretty town square and the restaurant Cecio!  Pesto was invented here in Cinque Terre so of course there were lots of pesto options on the menu.  It was very good!  Josh and Kaia had pesto spagetti; Jane and I had linguine with pesto.  We ate outside under an awning and had a beautiful view down the valley to the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable things is the walls in this area.  There are literally thousands of walls built to make it possible to grow grapes and other fruits and vegetables.  It would take Shane and his crew a hundred years to build all those walls.  We also saw some cute little 'roller coaster' vehicles, single rail electric powered cars for getting the crops up and down the sides of the hills.  We saw oranges and lemons and lots of other vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch and some wine we headed off toward city number four, Vernazza.  This was definitely the longest and most difficult part of the hike for the day.  And the sun came out in full force just in time to get us all hot and steamy along the way.  The hike was even slower and more difficult than usual because of the mud and slippery rocks.  However, along the way we had some spectacular views!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike to Vernazza took us an hour and forty five minutes and we were all very glad to get to town to find some drinks and gelato.  We also found two other fun items for purchase.  At a gastronome we bought some pesto in a jar, along with some special noodles produced in Cinque Terre.  These noodles resemble communion wafers more than anything else so it will be fun to cook them when we get home.  Across the street in a clothing store I found a pair of Capri pants, so now I can look 'tres european.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vernazza also has a small beach, so Jane and I sat on the bench while the kids waded in the water.  We had fun watching the kids and a golden retriever who raced around the beach with the same enthusiasm as Alley races around the backyard.  The golden seemed to think its job was to keep the beach free of Pigeons!  It was great fun watching him chase from one side to the other leaping at the Pigeons just as they took off to get out of his way.  Eventually the Pigeons gave up and found a quieter beach somewhere else.  Kaia adopted the dog as her new friend and spent some time petting and talking to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we decided to catch the 6:28 train to Monterosso al Mare, the most touristy of the five cities.  We only spent about 45 minutes in town walking around and looking at the beaches before we caught the 7:24 train back to La Spezia and our 1/4 tank of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out straight out of town for the Autostrasse hoping that the information we had received was correct.  I was worried that La Spezia would not be a very nice place to spend the night.  As we approached the entrance area to the highway the sign still showed that there was a strike and no gas was available on the way to Pisa.  We kept going, hoping that maybe we would find something.  The first station we saw did indeed look closed but the second station was an Agip and we saw cars by the pumps!  We pulled in and saw two attendents standing out by the pumps.  When the first asked if we wanted a fill up I answered 'YES FULL'  the kids say it is difficult to capture the depth of the emotion and relief in my voice when I said that and dubbed that the quote of the day.  I was indeed happy and very relieved to have a full tank of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good lesson.  It is amazing how much we take the availability of gasoline for granted.  I don't think anything like a gas strike could happen in the USA and I'm interested to read more when we get home to understand the motivation and background behind these periodic strikes here in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the gas station did not have any snacks and everyone was looking forward to a bit of junk food at this point.  We noticed along the way that several gas stations looked like the pumps were working even though the station houses themselves were closed up  tight.  So, we continued to our apartment and had a junk food supper of chips, salsa, cheese and crackers.  Parmigiano Reggiano is very good on crackers and flat bread!&lt;/p&gt;

Jane and I had watched a video about the town so we were excited to see the square in person.  The square in Siena is the sight of an annual horse race where they clear out all the restaurant tables and fill the outer ring of the square with dirt for the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in time for a late lunch in the square.  Rather than picking a more expensive restaurant somewhere in town we opted for sitting along the square and watching the people.  It was fun, although the lunch was not all that exciting.  Jane and I had Lasagne al Forno and Josh and Kaia each had a Salami and Fontina Panini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch it started to rain, so we lost our desire to wander around the hill towns of Tuscany.  We wandered by a few shops on our way out of town but our hearts just were not in the shopping or sight seeing today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed for our apartment hoping that maybe the weather there had been better.  Unfortunately the puddles and gutters of rain told us differently.  So we stayed around the apartment and read, Josh tried a Sudoku, then got Kaia to play Cribbage with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were waiting around, the gardener showed up with some Italian guy that we can only guess was the plumber, come to fix the hot water heater.  neither of them spoke any english so there was really nothing to do but show them to the bathroom and see what happened.  They left abut 10 minutes later, and miraculously the water heater seems to work 100% better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner tonight we wanted to try Casa Masi again.  We arrived at a little before 7:30 but it was full so we made a reservation for friday night.  We decided to give Il Lago a try.  Il Lago means the lake and Il Lago was a restaurant built around a small lake.  We quickly realized that this was not so much a restaurant as it was a place to hold a wedding and wedding reception if you come to Tuscany for that sort of thing.  We were seated in a large glassed in room with many tables and only one overworked italian grandmother to wait on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner was mostly forgettable.  Kaia only ordered tagliatelli basilica which was pretty good.  Josh ordered a steak, Jane ordered Gnudi, which was good, and misto of rabbit, chicken, lamb and vegetables.  It all came deep fried which made it hard to figure out what was what.  I ordered crostini to start followed by tagliatelli with mushroom pan sauce followed by steak.  By the time I got my steak everyone else had finished all their courses.  Maybe the best thing we had was an order of pommes frittes which we saw another table order.  Thinking they would be good with steak I asked for some but they came before I even got my pasta so they were long gone by the time my steak showed up.  We arrived home at 10:00 tired and ready for a day of hiking tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

So we got up and drove to the town of Empoli.  It is definitely a commuter town as we had a heck of a time finding a parking spot since we got there about 9am.  We got our ticket and took a slow roller into Firenze Santa Maria Novella station.  This is the station where all the books warn you about pick pockets.  Luckily we made it in and out unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got off the train we made straight for The science museum.  Since it was Tuesday the museum was only open until 13:00.  It was great, this will definitely be one of the highlights of the trip for me.  Anyone who is interested in Physics would love this museum.  There are exhibits of real early scientific instruments including astrolabes, Sextants, early batteries, Galileo's first and second telescopes, early microscopes, the list goes on.  Every one of them is a great example of early science and many of them are really illustrative of important discoveries in Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished our tour of the science museum just in time for lunch.  So we took another Rick Steve's recommendation and went for a late lunch at the Golden Wall -- Open Bar.  It was great.  They gave us a table right on a corner window where we could look out at the Arno river and the Ponte Veccio.  We watched several groups of rowers out for their daily exercise and enjoyed a good lunch.  Kaia had a pear and cheese salad followed by Ravioli stuffed with Ricotta and Basil, I had Bruschetta con quattro formagio e Truffles for my first course followed by Gnocchi with Sausage and mushrooms.  Josh had a Mezzaluna (part pizza part Calzone), and Jane had fresh Mozzarela with Basil and Tomatoes followed  by a foccacia of Mozzarella and Tomatoes.  It was a bit much of the same for Jane between the first and second courses.  Overall a good meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we were fortified with a good lunch we decided to find the Duomo.  We lucked out and caught a relatively short line for climbing to the top.  The line was much shorter than the climb to the top.  463 Stairs!  The first part of the climb was pretty standard fair, some spiral staircases...  We had a nice break in the middle where we could view the dome from the inside and look down into the sanctuary.   As we got closer to the top the stairs got steeper and steeper and we lost the spiral approach and started spiraling around the dome itself.  The rise was almost one foot by the time we got to the very where we were climbing along the very top of the dome itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the climb followed the stairs between the two layers of the dome.  The inner layer is very thick, and the outer layer is only 82 cm thick.  You could see the herringbone pattern that the bricklayers used in laying the bricks for the dome itself.  By the time we got to the top we were all hot and sweaty.  Unfortunately Jane got stuck behind a very hot and sweaty German guy who forgot to use his deodorant!!  Nobody was happier to get to the top and out into the fresh air than Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view from the top was amazing.  We could see every direction, and looking down on the top of this ancient city was really beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three days without internet contact, which seemed like much longer to all of us, we found a small Internet Cafe  so we could check our email before we headed back to the train station and our journey back to our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we were sidetracked along the way by more shopping.  Jane found a winter scarf, Kaia found T shirts for her friends back home, and Josh found a pair of Italian Nikes.  Unfortunately for Josh they did not have the shoes in his size.  In the meantime I found a soccer warmup set that seemed like it would make nice lounge wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain at Il Lebbio continued while we were gone and when we returned everything just felt damp.  Jane made the comment that this was like camping.  All of our clothes just had a damp feeling to them.  It would be nice to have forced air heat or even air conditioning just to dry things out in our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

We had tickets to climb the leaning tower at 9:00, so we had to get under way in good time.  That meant getting up at 6:30 to be on the road in time to get to Pisa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking in Pisa is difficult.  Even at our early hour we had to drive around for a while to find a parking spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaning tower really does lean.  Quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing the tower was very interesting.  At times it felt like we were going up a really steep hill but at other times it felt like we were almost going down hill while climbing the stairs.  It was a very strange feeling.  The spiral stairways started out wide and got continually more narrow as we ascended.  By the time we got to the top the staircase was barely wide enough for my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sine we finished our sight seeing pretty early we decided to find a place to pick up some of the additional supplies we needed for our apartment, such as beach towels and toilet paper.  So I took a guess with the GPS and we found a mall with a great big coop.  This seems to be the equivalent of a Target store matched with a Lunds.  Lots of good fresh food in the deli and meat areas and lots of fresh cheeses.  In addition to the usual stuff you find in Target.  I was also able to find a new pair of reading glasses for just 18 euros.  I think its a much better pair than I have found at home so maybe its not wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are in Tuscany here is a bit about our 'Villa.'  We have a living room, a small eating area and a small kitchen.  The kitchen has a range and a toaster oven along with an assortment of small pots and pans.  If this is the size pan that most everyone uses over here it is no wonder that the small french tops work just fine.  The floors are all red tile and the ceilings and columns are all brick.  It feels very Tuscan and it is quite charming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two bedrooms and two bathrooms.  The kids have a bedroom with three single beds.  Their bathroom is down the hall.  Jane and I have a king size bed along with our own bathroom.  The water heater is located in our bathroom and is an 'on demand' kind of heater. That is whenever you turn on hot water the water heater springs into action.  The only problem with this is it takes quite a while to get warm water, and our water heater is a little finicky.  Sometimes it heats and sometimes it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager is not here all the time so getting someone to fix the water heater could be a bit tricky.  Since I am complaining  a bit I will say that the weather has been rainy and damp, and our apartment is just as damp as the outside.  All our clothes feel damp, and we have been trying to wash clothes for a couple of days and it is impossible to get them to line dry in this weather.  Finally I decided to light a fire in our fireplace to help the clothes dry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I cooked dinner in the apartment.  After our interesting shopping trip at the coop in Pisa I had the ingredients to make a nice Risotto.  Of course since we could not find chicken broth (brodo e pollo) I had to make some stock from scratch.  With no decent size frying pan I decided to just throw the chicken into the sofrito and let it cook along with the rice.  That worked out fine, and of course everything came together perfectly at the end when I added some of the nice Parmigianno Reggiano.  Along with some nice tuscan wine it was a very good meal.  Josh seemed to really like it as he had about four helpings.  Maybe it was just nice for him to get something he liked besides pizza!&lt;/p&gt;

We went to Volterra and San Giamanginino, two of the ancient Etruscan hill towns in Tuscany.  The etruscans predated the Greeks and were equally as advanced in art and science.  It is really interesting to look out at the horizon and you can see many little towns, each perched on the top of one hill or another.  The valleys are all full and planted with vines and other crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the towns are all on tops of hills makes driving challenging.  You don't follow a nice straight road through the valleys, but rather you go up one hill then down then up again, winding in and around farms, villas, and the occasional castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volterra is a beautiful city.  It is much like what you would find in other large european cities but has a much smaller feel.  Although on sunday afternoon it was still pretty crowded with tourists.  We checked out the Etruscan museum which had some interesting artifacts from etruscan life along with hundreds of urns to hold the cremated ashes of ancient etruscans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a late lunch at one of Rick Steve's recommended restaurants.  When we walked in there was hardly anyone there but it was full when we left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Volterra we drove to San Gimiangno which is another etruscan hill town.  It was also interesting but it was even more full of tourists than Volterra.  It was in SG that I realized that shopping appears to be a very large part of the european vacation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our trip to the hill towns we decided to try dinner at one of the restaurants recommended by the manager of Il Lebbio.  We drove into town and Tried Casa Masi, but it was full, so we continued on to Carpe Diem.  This was a restaurant that was attached to one of the hotels in Montaione.  They have a large outdoor seating area and and inside area with a great view.  We did not have a reservation so we ended up sitting back from the view.  The menu was nice and had several good looking wines as well.  We were all a bit tired of Pasta tonight so we tried a little different menu.  Crepes, Beef Chunks, Dory and Pork chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service was extremely slow even by Italian restaurant standards.  But at the conclusion of our meal the manager apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the palace we wandered back to our hotel and tried out one of the recommended restaurants.  The pizzeria around the corner in the Piazza.  Since they didn't start serving pizza until noon we found ourselves with an extra 20 minutes for sipping pop and water.  We made the mistake of each ordering a pizza.  I had the proscuitto, Josh had Margheritta, and Jane and Kaia each had a cheese and basil combo.  Josh and I only at about half of ours, but Kaia ate her whole pizza!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty drive to Tuscany.  Many tunnels and in and out of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner tonight we took one of our managers recommendations and dined at Il Cammieneto.  While we were there we had a short conversation with a group of Germans.  When we told them we were from Iowa they smiled brightly and said Ahhh, &amp;quot;Big Potatoes!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

There are signs everywhere point you toward to major landmarks, the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a small breakfast in our hotel we set out to take the tour of the Grand Canal.  From the St. Romana Vaporetto stop we listened to the National Geographic tour of the canal as we headed around the S curve toward St. Marks.  It is hard to follow as all the buildings along the canal are similar in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we finished to tour we walked around St. Marks for a while.  Josh wanted to spend one euro to buy some corn to get the pigeons to perch on his arms.  I would not let him as they are so dirty and gross.  We were supposed to meet up with Ulring's outside their hotel we waited for a while before leaving a note that we were headed to lunch.  We just missed them by a couple minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a delicious lunch at one of the places recommended by our hotel manager.  Jane had ravioli, I had gnocchi, Josh had tortellini soup and Kaia had spaghetti and meatballs.  Jane and I also had a small pitcher of prosecco, which turned out to be a sparkling wine.  It was all very good, but the cost was a surprising 63 euros.  Each of our lunches on the menu listed for about 7 euros but they charged more since we were having them as our only course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About halfway through lunch the Ulrings caught up with us and sat down to eat as well.  So we added dessert, which was very good.  We split an order of Tirimisu and an icream truffle.  The truffle tasted like a layer of angel food cake wrapped around a core of mocha ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we just started walking around parts of venice we had not explored yet.  We didn't know where we were going or what we were headed toward but it was fun and we saw a lot of interesting shops and lots of interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made two stops for snacks during the afternoon.  One for gelato and one for pizza and a sit down. The pizza place was good and it was fairly close to our hotel.  It looked like rain so we stopped to pick up umbrellas and rain gear.  We asked if we could sit in the lobby of our hotel and play cards but we were told that the tables were for breakfast only and playing cards there was not possible.  So we decided to walk toward the Londra Palace.  About halfway there it started to rain pretty hard.  But with our Umbrellas in hand we kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Londra Palace we were all wet, but just minutes after we sat down in the lobby the skies opened up and it POURED.  So we ordered a couple bottles of wine and played some five hundred.  Jim and I soundly beat the women three games to one, even though I had really crappy cards again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over cards we looked at the really expensive menu for the hotel and decided to go elsewhere unless it was really raining.   Since it was clearing up we headed out to find something.  We ended up at what turned out to be a really bad restaurant.  Everything was very forgettable and my crab must have come from a can.  As we say, every vacation must have a worst restaurant.  We thought it was L'Arche (the french version of an Oasis on the tollway) but I think this was worse.&lt;/p&gt;

First we went back down the mountain, and then we moved a ways to the east and went back up and over the mountain.  The drive through the mountains was pretty.  Lots of great long bridges and many many tunnels.  The nicest tunnels were not really tunnels but rather covered roadways.  This protects the cars from landslides as well as snowfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got into Italy we drove around the outside of Milano.  The traffic was &amp;quot;intenso&amp;quot; and the going was rather slow.  About 1:00 we were hungry enough that we decided to check out the next town for some food.  We saw a mall off to the side of the road so we checked it out.  We decided to have some pizza at a restaurant called &amp;quot;Pizza Pause.&amp;quot;  This was fine except that the young man waiting on us did not speak a word of english.  We nearly ended up with twice as much pizza as we wanted.  In the end it worked out fine and the pizza was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty confusing getting into the parking lot in Venice called Tronchetto. And once we got there we had to figure out where we were going to get to the Vaporetto and where we were going to get our tickets etc.  It all worked out just fine and we ended up on the right Vaporetto to our stop and San Ste.  From there it was a tricky but short walk to our hotel, the Hotel San Angelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room is not too big, but it has two nice beds and a couch to sit on.  The bathroom has a toilet and Duvet along with the tub/shower.  All the lights in the room go out if you take the key out of the slot next to the door.  The Internet service does not work like it should.  there is some problem getting it to accept the security password for the wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting settled we decided to take a walk before we headed down to meet Ulring's at their hotel.  Venice has thousands and thousands of little shops to look at and walk through.  Of course now that we were in Italy Josh was on full alert for a Totti soccer shirt.  We saw a couple of stalls selling soccer shirts and we managed to get by the first couple.  But, once we got to the Rialto bridge they had a store that was selling genuine Soccer shirts and that was pretty much the end of it.  69 euros later Josh had a genuine italian soccer shirt.  They print the name and number on the shirt once it is chosen, so we had 20 minutes to kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a restaurant at the base of the Rialto bridge that had a nice view of the water, so we sat down there for a beer, wine and soda.   After watching the people for 20 minutes Josh and I walked back to pick up his shirt.  As promised the shirt was ready and waiting for us and Josh was one happy boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we were crossing the top of the Rialto, we saw the Ulrings!  Who would have thought that we would just randomly find them here in the city.  They joined us for a little refreshment while we planned our move for supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recommendations from our hotel manager Jim and Nancy had found an Indian restaurant and a Thai restaurant not too far from our hotel.  After some walking around we decided on the Indian restaurant called -  - We had an excellent meal.  The kids all had Lashkis (sweet yoghurt drinks) along with Naan (bread) and several different curries.  I had the chicken Vinaloo, Jane had Chicken Curry, Jim had a shrimp dish and Nancy had Chicken Khorma.  The chicken Khorma proved to be very popular with the kids as well.  Josh even said he liked the sauce on his rice.  We also had a variety of tandoori food as part of an appetizer plate.  It was all good, and the total for all nine of us was 190 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we walked some more until we all decided to split up and head for our hotels for the night.  The plan is to meet the next day at noon at the statue in front of Ulring's hotel, the Londra Palace.&lt;/p&gt;

We had two main choices for our main activity today:  Take a gondola up to the highest point where we could see the mountains of Switzerland, France, and Italy, or take a train ride up the valley.  We decided on the first option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was actually composed of three gondola rides to get to the top.  And we were really truly at the top.  We walked through a tunnel in the paradise glacier and then took an elevator up a little bit to a platform that was at 13,300 feet.  From there we had a panoramic view of three countries!  There are not enough adjectives to describe the view from this place.  Not only could we see that Matterhorn but we had a crystal clear view of Mont Blanc in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paradise glacier also features a set of tunnels that have been  constructed to display various kinds of ice sculpture.  From the lift area we had to hike down through the snow a bit to get to the entrance.  After the entrance we continued down on a path until we reached an area where the tunnels leveled out. There were a few interesting sculptures and some history on the glacier itself.  Josh was a bit nervous about going inside a glacier so he did not enjoy it as much as others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day's sights are really more about pictures than words.  We all agreed that it was cool to visit the Matterhorn and see the great sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back down in the village we dropped off our gear and extra layers back at the hotel and then went to walk around the city of Zermatt.  Josh had been in search of sunglasses since the beginning of the trip so we hoped to find something cheap for him.  In the end we couldn't find any sunglasses for less than 39 swiss francs so Josh got Jane's and Jane got a new pair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a mid-afternoon snack of bratwurst (6sf) and ice cream (3 sf for a single scoop).  Along the way we ran across a couple of interesting looking restaurants including an asian fusion restaurant and one that Jane had read about called GramPi's.  So we made a reservation for 8:00pm.  After a bit more walking and looking we decided to head back to the hotel to enjoy a rest in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought the pool had a jacuzzi but when we got there we found a permanently attached sign that indicated that the jacuzzi was out of order.  So we just had to swim around and play frisbee for a while.  The water was not hot tub temperature but it was warm enough for swimming and playing in comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a delicious dinner at GramPi's.  Josh had a Hawaiian pizza, I had Lasagne, Kaia had tortellini stuffed with cheese and basil in a basil cream sauce.  Jane had a pepperoni pizza.  Cost was about 75 swiss francs.  We think Kaia had the best meal.  Jane described the tortellini as heavenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went back to the hotel.  The cheese fondue smell in the lobby was really good.  We decided to give Josh and Jane another chance to beat Kaia and I at 500 but it was not to be.  The score for vacation so far is B,K 3  J,J 0!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all went to bed about 10:00 hoping that we would get a good night sleep, with a plan to have breakfast at 8 and leave for the banhoff at 9:00.&lt;/p&gt;

After breakfast I called Dwight on Skype to let him know we were on our way to Geneve.  The plan is to meet him at the departures bridge at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning it is still quite cool (7 C) but the sun is shining and the clouds look like they might be breaking up.  We are on the road at 8:30 headed for Geneve to have lunch with Dwight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met Dwight at the airport as planned and let him take over the driving. Laurance was not able to join us as she was not feeling well.  Dwight said she had been having some bad morning sickness. He took us to downtown Geneve and we walked around the old walled city and past the giant fountain out in the lake.  The fountain shoots a hundred feet into the air and the wind makes it look like the sail on a boat as it comes back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a wonderful lunch at a small restaurant in the old part of town called Brasserie du Bourg-de-Four.   Jane and I had Roesti with Jambon, Ouefs (eggs), and fromage.  It was delicious!!  Kaia had some bowtie pasta with parmesan cheese basil and ham.  Josh had a ham and cheese omlette.  We were stuffed.  Cost for lunch for 5 of us was 123.70 Swiss Francs.  Dwight reminded me that I did not need to leave a tip, that throughout europe gratuities were built into the price.  For exceptional service you might round up and leave a couple extra euros.  This means that a couple of people have really gotten good tips from me along the way! While we were eating lunch Laurance called to see if we wanted to stop by their house for some dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a very short visit and some desert with Dwight and Laurance and then took off toward Zermatt.  The drive was very scenic, especially the last 30km.  There were lots of waterfalls along the way and we began to suspect that they had had snow here recently.  We drove the car to Tasch and parked it in the lot.  Then we took a 20 minute train ride into the town of Zermat.  There are only electric carts in the town.  A porter from the hotel met us at the train station and drove us to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park Hotel Beausite is spectacular, really, really spectacular!  We have the center suite with a little cupola that sticks above the rest of the hotel with a 360 degree view of the mountains surrounding us.  For all the clouds and bad weather we have had the last two days we are in luck today.  All the clouds have dissipated and left us with a spectacular view of the Matterhorn!  We are all really excited about the room and the wonderful views.  I wish we could stay here several days just to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner we learned that while we were visiting castles in the Loire Valley, Zermatt was getting 15cm of fresh snow!  In fact we learned that many of the roads leading to Tasch were closed the day before, so we were lucky we didn't try to come a day earlier!  Today there is still snow on many of the rooftops and in their gardens.  Everything has greened up and so the snow looks very clean and white against the spring green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner at the hotel was a five course feast!  It was barbecue night so the menu went as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cream of vegetable soup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fish course, they had a wide assortment of fresh fish to choose and then they grill it for you. (Josh: John Dorry, Jane: Red Mullet, Brad: Blue Marlin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salad course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meat course, again they had a huge assortment of meats beef, veal, ostrich, wild boar, rabbit, pork, turkey, chicken, etc. to choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheese course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desert course including Creme Caramel, A Citrus ice cream with vodka, a fuit plate, or a banana split.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner took from 8:45 until almost 11:00.  So we went back to the room, and looked at the mountains some more.  We played a round of 500 and then took some long exposure pictures of the matterhorn.  I think they turned out pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;

Our agenda includes two castles to visit (Chambord and Chenenceaux) and an overnight stay at the Chateau Malmont.  Unlike Versailles, these castles are all considered to be pleasure palaces, not palaces of governance.  They were designed as hunting lodges and entertainment centers for the royalty.  Chambord was absolutely huge.  Construction was started by Francios I and continued by  Louis XIV (the Sun King) and was finished by the people of France for Henri, the grandson of Charles X who never actually assumed the throne or lived in the restored castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After touring the castle we bought some supplies that were locally made and grown.  This included some farmers cheese, Saucisson, and two loaves of bread.   I would have bought the Chevre but I was not sure what to do with the moldy crust!  I made sandwiches for everyone with my trusty swiss army knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chenenceaux was much smaller, it was built for the mistress of Henri but taken back by his wife Catherine Medici when Henri died.  It is built out over the river Cher and has wonderful views.  The best thing about Chenenceaux was the kitchens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After visiting the two castles we had another 3 hours to drive to Chateaux Malmont where we stayed the night.  We were really glad to have the GPS this afternoon.  From the freeway the Chateaux is really in the middle of nowhere.  I couldn't believe  the little roads we were on were even part of the map database!  We were actually a little paniced when the GPS ran out of batteries just after we got off the freeway.  Luckily josh had a partially used pair from his gameboy that had enough juice to get us to the castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malmont was also a hunting lodge and was much smaller than either castle we visited earlier.  It was realy nice inside and they had an indoor and outdoor pool.  Since the weather was quite cold (8 C) Josh took full advantage of the indoor pool which was in a barrel vaulted room that used to be the guard room.  While Josh was in the pool, Kaia went for a 4 mile run and Jane rented a bike to follow behind her.  The bike wasn't very good so Jane got a tougher workout than Kaia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our suite was two bed rooms with big high ceilings, a WC and a bathroom.  Jane and I had a double bed and the kids had single beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chateaux had a restaurant and a tavern.  The restaurant was closed on monday nights so we ate in the tavern, which was still quite formal.  The menu was three fixed price options based on how many and which courses you had (17.50 - 24 euros).  In fact the wine was cheaper than the meals.  That does not happen very often back home!  The best quote of the day came at dinner when we were sitting at the table and Josh just blurted out:  &amp;quot;We're in a castle!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane, Kaia and I had the entree of Guinea Fowl in puff pastry, for the main course Jane had Duck, and Josh, Kaia and I had the steak.  Next up was the cheese course with a variety of different cheeses and finally desert which included a small layered cake that tasted like it had a rhubarb middle.  Along with the cake we each had a scoop of ice cream.  We were all trying to figure out what kind of ice cream it was so we tried to ask the server, who spoke no english that we could tell.  Kaia deciphered that it was green apple ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of the trip is...
* Dad:  Chenenceaux
* Mom:  Chenenceaux and Chambord
* Kaia:
* Josh:&lt;/p&gt;

See Rodin's thinker in the Rodin gardin, visit the Musee D'Orsay, Visit the Versailles palace, and go up the Eiffel tower.  When we left the apartment it was nice although a bit cool.  We went to the marketplace again and got pain, gruyere fromage, jambon, and cherries.  We carried our breakfast thinking we would eat it in the garden, but the garden was not public and we didn't want to spend any time in the musee so we continued to the Orsay.  We ate our breakfast in front of the musee and then went in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again the Rick Steve's commentaries were really good.  I learned more about realism, and impressionism than I ever knew before.  Renoir, Monet, Manet, Whistler, Rodin, it was really good.  D'Orsay used to be a train station and the huge high arching ceiling is still preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finished we noticed that it had started to rain, so we decided to take the train straight out to Versailles.  On the way, we passed the statue of liberty, it looks just like the one in New York except it is on the river here in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we reached Versailles the weather was really cold and rainy.  We dashed across the street to get some food at McDonalds!  The bacon on the burgers was excellent!  After lunch we tried to start walking but it was so cold and rainy we turned right around and ran back into the mall.  We found a souvenir shop that had some sweatshirts, we bought 4 sweatshirts and 2 umbrellas.  We have vowed that we will do better at checking the weather forecast for the day in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Versailles palace was moderately interesting.  Admission included an audio tour but it was not nearly as interesting as the Rick Steves guides.  The rooms were interesting but the commentary most mostly about who made the furniture when, and how many coats of laquer were applied.  Not so intersting unless you are a furniture maker.  We did learn more about the history of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI which was good.  We stayed through 2/3 of our tour but the line to get into the kings chambers in the main hall was just too long to stand in during a cold rain so we headed back and took the train back to town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back in town we came to the apartment to rest and relax a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner tonight was at a Bistro down the road.  Kaia and I had Chicken Shishkebab with curry sauce, Jane had Duck with honey sauce, Josh had Beef rib, which was a ribeye steak.  Again it was all good.  After dinner we had a chocolate crepe and a crepe with sugar, almonds, cinnamon and citron (lemon juice).  A great desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the best part of the trip is....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaia:  Notre Dame, the food in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josh:  Notre Dame except I had to pee really bad, and the crepes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom:   Notre Dame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dad:   Musee D'Orsay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Josh really wanted to buy a box of raspberries, so we did and they were the best raspberries anybody had ever had.  A little further down the street we discovered a bakery.  So we had a baguette, and chocolate eclair, and a doughnut.  All very fresh and good.  Decorah really needs a market area like this... (perhaps as part of the Kellog grant proposal Brenda could do this)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our little breakfast we walked, over the bridge to the grand palace, down the road to the obelisk, onward to point zero, further still to the Louvre.  In the Louvre we walked.  The Rick Steve's iPod tour was really helpful and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family seems to have three speeds when going through a museum.  Josh and Mom lead the way, Dad is in the middle, and Kaia wants to savor every work of art.  In the Louvre we saw many classic greek and roman works of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Louvre was very interesting we saw the Mona Lisa of course, along with many other famous works including Winged Victory, and the Venus DiMilo.  It was a good learning experience as we learned how the greek artistry influenced the romans and other artists for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was at the Cafe Beaux Arts, just a random place we picked as we walked by.  Josh had a cheeseburger, can you believe it?  Kaia had Penne with fresh basil and red sauce.  Jane and I both had a hot ham and cheese sandwich (Jambon avec Fromage) on toasted bread.  The sandwich was delicious.  In keeping with French tradition we had a small glass of wine.  So far the idea that wine is cheaper than pop does not seem to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we continued walking, walking, walking down the the island in the Seine.  We went to Notre Dame cathedral, and the center point which is right out front.  The center point is the place that all other distances in France are measured from.  The cathedral was amazing.  When we got there the line to go in to the main cathedral was long so we went around the corner and got in line to go up the tower.  This turned out to be a good decision, as the views were just great.  In addition once at the top you get to go into the bell tower itself to see a GIANT bell.  The radius at the bottom must be a good 10-12 feet and is so heavy you can't really make it move back and forth by pushing on it.  After the large bell we were able to continue even farther up the bell tower for even better views of the city. The weather was a little cloudy so the Eiffel tower was in a haze in our picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got done with the tower tour the line was nothing to get into the cathedral.  So we went inside.  Mass was in progress but tourists were still allowed to wander around the perimeter.  The rose window and the organ were both beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we finished the cathedral we were getting pretty tired, so we decided to get a quick snack.  We had a crepe chocolate to split.  Very very good.  We continued down to the last little island called Isle St. Louis.  Here there were many nice shops and restaurants.  On the way off the island we stopped to watch a street performer for a while.  He was an acrobat and had a fun show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that time we were really tired and wanted to catch a boat ride back up the river.  But we couldn't seem to find the right one so we gave up and walked, walked, walked back to the apartment.  We were all very foot sore by the time we made it to the apartment.  I think none of us thought we would walk that far and we were sorry we didn't have the pedometer to keep track. We do know that we climbed 400 stairs in Notre Dame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short rest, and some consulting of Rick Steve's we decided to find dinner somewhere close by.  Dinner was at La Arcade.  We tried to get in at several of Rick Steve's recommended places but they were all quite busy.  Josh had Duck, Kaia had Chevre in Phyllo Dough, I had rack of Lamb, and Jane had Prawns.&lt;/p&gt;

We drove through some rain and thunder to get to the airport in Cedar Rapids.  Unfortunately it was also windy in Chicago which was a bad omen for us.  Our flight was delayed getting to CR and once we got out to the end of the runway the dreaded ground stop announcement came.  Chicago was not allowing us to take off because they had no landing slots.  So we sat at the end of the runway for 45 minutes and one more rain squall before we could finally take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we began our descent into Chicago we watched helplessly as the time ticked closer to 4:30, our scheduled departure time.  Our only hope was that our outbound flight was as delayed as everything else.  This was not to be.  We got off the plane and ran across 2 concourses to get to our gate only to find out the plane had left without us.  We were told to go to K6, the rebooking gate.  The line there looked 2 hours long at least.  Jane tried to talk to the gate agent for the paris flight but they told us there was not enough time to get our bags on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we were standing in line, using Kaia's cell phone to call the rebooking number with a hold time of more than 28 minutes.  Finally I was able to flag down a manager (Shawn ) and I asked him why we couldn't get on the Paris flight.  When I explained that it looked like we were going to miss an entire day of our vacation I think he felt sorry for us.  So, he looked on the computer and said we could fly to Frankfurt and then back to Brussels.   That flight left at 7:00.  When he went to change our booking he discovered that we had already been rebooked on a flight to London connecting to Brussels.  How we were ever supposed to discover that is a huge mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flight to London we were given the very back row of seats in the 777.  This means we were even behind the bathrooms.  The flight attendant told us he would move us up because it was a very smelly place to sit.  He was a really nice guy and moved us to bulkhead seats in row 20, which made for a pretty comfortable flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had five hours in Heathrow to kill, so we tried to get some sleep in the international lounge.  Once on our plane to Brussels we were seated in front of three obnoxious women (kind of like the nightmare version of Bridget Jone's Diary)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in Brussels everything went very smoothly, all the luggage was intact, we zipped through customs and didn't even have to wait at the car rental counter.  We had a little fun trying to get our first tank of gas since I went to the Belgium card side of the gas station and none of my credit cards would work.  I finally learned that we need to go to the other side of the gas station to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are enroute to Paris!  So far the GPS has been working and have not gotten lost yet.  We hid major rush hour traffic in Brussels and were zooming along toward paris until just a moment ago when we hit a big slowdown.  Josh is enjoying our drive to Paris by looking at all the cars he would like to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this in the car, we are all tired and hungry so are very much looking forward to getting to our apartment and having an evening meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jane and I left the kids in the apartment and parked the car we all went for a walk to check out the eiffel tower at night.  Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had late night pizza at La Gourmandise.  A little Pizza shop that seated about 16 people max.  Josh and I split a Pizza Margherita avec chorizo and Jane and Kaia split the four fromage pizza.  Very good.&lt;/p&gt;

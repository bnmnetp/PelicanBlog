&lt;p&gt;Just a week ago all the trees were green!  Now this morning I looked out across the lake and it was beautiful in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="m-image" src="https://bnmnetp.github.io/PelicanBlog/Cabin/south_end.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the morning I was treated to more colors on my bike ride around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

A great day to get out the Fat Bike and give it a try on the ice and snow.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we celebrated Christmas with Kaia, Tanner, Josh, and Rachel a week ago its a pretty quiet christmas eve.  But the temperatures are decent, the lake is frozen, and so it seemed like a good time to give the fatty a try on the lake.  It. was. awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Temps in the 20's mean its a good time to try fatty on the ice&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rode out and around the big island.  Then down to the point and back across the lake and along our shoreline.  Not a very long ride, but next time I'll dress warmer, and put something across my mouth to help keep the cold air from triggering some kind of asthmatic thing with my lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="m-figure"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Even though it was only 3:00 you can see sunset coming on&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was a darn good year.  Sad to see it go, but looking forward to an even more exiting 2019.  Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as a break from coding, I trimmed it up a bit, and added a little bit of Eva Cassidy (Oh, Had I a Golden Thread) which seemed to fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had shot it in landscape instead of portrait but I just grabbed my phone and started to film.  Its amazing how the shape of the wings change and how it uses both front and back wings on each side.  It looks so frantic at full speed, but it looks really graceful in super-slow-mo.&lt;/p&gt;

That was the winter of 1880-1881 in case you are wondering.  Lately my reading tastes lean more towards the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and the coming long winter in that story.  Yesterday I arrived back in Minnesota after a chilly week in Atlanta, You will note by the date it is already the 8th of March.  I'm writing this simply to document how much snow we've had here at Bone Lake this winter!  As I pulled onto Indian Point road, I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Where's the Sign?" src="/images/Winter2014/IndianPoint.JPG" title="Where's the Sign?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I'd been seeing road signs totally buried in huge snow drifts since I turned North off highway 8, so I wasn't totally surprised that all the signs were buried.  I wondered what our driveway would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="driveway" src="/images/Winter2014/FrontEntry.JPG" title="driveway"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, guests are not going to have much of a view out the guest bedroom window, or the downstairs bathroom I guess.  I wonder how long this will last?  We might have to start a pool, to see when the last of the snow finally melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily we had plenty of wood inside to light a fire, because I really would not want to wade through all of this to restock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wood pile" src="/images/Winter2014/WoodPile.JPG" title="wood pile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webcam down by the lake has not been communicating for a while now, so I decided to make the trek down to the lake to see if I could reboot it and get it to talk to the wireless again.  Yikes, the snow was up to my hips.  Which nearly resulted in a trashed iPhone due to snow getting in my pockets and down my pants.  (Sorry for that image)  It turns out that even a tiny bit of moisture inside the earphone jack will make the iPhone think you have headphones plugged in.  This disables the earpiece, and makes phone calls pretty tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

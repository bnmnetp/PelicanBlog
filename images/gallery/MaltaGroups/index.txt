Malta and the Mediterranean 2015
--------------------------------

I have come to love this group over the past four months of living and traveling together.  Here are some group photos collected together from our first photo after the *Malta Experience* in Valletta to the wine tastings in Sicily and Meridiana.

* Malta
* Rome
* Morocco
* Istanbul
* Sicily

Thirty two photos do not tell the entire story of the semester, but there is a story behind each of these photos.  A story of how we have come together as friends and family over the last four months.  Thanks everyone!

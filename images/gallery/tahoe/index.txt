Spring Break in Tahoe!
----------------------

Some highlight photos of our great trip with Welshons and Moens during Spring Break of 2014.

We had one fantastic day of hiking around the lake.  No wind, temperatures in the 70's.  A great lunch with our friends Jim and Karen and Jim's brother Tom.

Then, we had to great days of skiing.  One spring skiing day, and thanks to some fresh snow overnight, a second day that felt like peak season skiing.

Happy New Year!

Celebrating the new year in Australia is definitely something special.  Everywhere we went the air in the city smelled like barbecue, and people were queueing to get into the free parks all afternoon.  There is definitely a lot of pride by the people of Sydney in their preparations for the big show.  We spent a good part of the morning hiking around Bondi beach and the surrounding area.  Then we just chilled at the flat for most of the afternoon, watching the families queuing to get the best position to view the fireworks.   

When they opened the gates to the park right below our flat at 6:00 it had the feel of a giant family picnic!

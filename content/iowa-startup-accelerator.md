It has been an exciting day!   I just got back from Cedar Rapids where I attended a mixer of mentors and teams at the[ Iowa Startup Accelerator](http://www.iowastartupaccelerator.com).  The accelerator officially launched yesterday with 10 new teams.  There was some good local [news coverage](http://www.cbs2iowa.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/created-corridor-ia-startup-accelerator-28963.shtml) and lots of excitement by the teams.  Some of them are from Iowa and one team is from as far away as Australia.

My role, as a mentor, will be to work with one or more teams over the next few months, giving them advice and feedback, and trying to connect them with the right people to help them grow their company.  Over the next few weeks I'll be spending some time meeting with each of the ten teams to get to know them better, and then we will see if there is a particular team that I can really help.  I hope so, tonight was fun, and the enthusiasm is infectious.

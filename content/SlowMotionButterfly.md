Description: A little fun with my iPhone and super slow motion.

Sitting on the deck yesterday, we noticed this butterfly hard at work.  Polinating the flowers like crazy.  So I grabbed my phone and set it to super slow motion and shot a few seconds of this hard worker.

Today, as a break from coding, I trimmed it up a bit, and added a little bit of Eva Cassidy (Oh, Had I a Golden Thread) which seemed to fit.

I wish I had shot it in landscape instead of portrait but I just grabbed my phone and started to film.  Its amazing how the shape of the wings change and how it uses both front and back wings on each side.  It looks so frantic at full speed, but it looks really graceful in super-slow-mo.

Description: A little fun with my iPhone and super slow motion.

Sitting on the deck yesterday, we noticed this butterfly hard at work.  Polinating the flowers like crazy.  So I grabbed my phone and set it to super slow motion and shot a few seconds of this hard worker.

Today, as a break from coding, I trimmed it up a bit, and added a little bit of Eva Cassidy (Oh, Had I a Golden Thread) which seemed to fit.

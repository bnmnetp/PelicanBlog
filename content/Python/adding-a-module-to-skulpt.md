Now that I'm back from traveling in South America I've started on a project to add a turtle graphics module to skulpt. &nbsp;Skulpt is a javascript implementation of Python written by Scott Graham, and is available on skulpt.googlecode.com. &nbsp;Its a very nice project because it allows you to embed a Python interpreter right in your web page. &nbsp;I've written about how to do this <a href="http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/python-in-your-browser-in-javascript.html">in a previous post.</a><br />The skulpt interpreter works like a charm, but it does not yet have any of the Python standard library modules implemented. &nbsp;Scott has been working with wrapping some of Googles closure libraries, and has a webgl module too. &nbsp;But none of your regular Python friends are available, things like math, random, turtle, etc need to be implemented. &nbsp;For the most part these things are already available in javascript so the work is in creating the module and then wrapping the underlying Javascript inside the standard Python API.<br />Where to start? &nbsp;There's not a lot of documentation provided for skulpt, so I'm hoping this post will be enough to help others get going a bit quicker. &nbsp;Scott was very helpful in responding to all my emails so this is not a criticism of him, rather I'm hoping this will save him the effort the next time someone wants to extend skulpt. &nbsp;So, here's the deal. &nbsp;skulpt relies on two javascript files the first is skulpt.js &nbsp;and builtin.js &nbsp;A very minimal installation only uses skulpt.js, whereas if you want to use any modules they are in builtin.js. &nbsp;Looking around the distribution you will not immediately find skulpt.js because you need to build it. You get a sculpt.js file by using the m script that comes with the distribution. &nbsp;running m --help will give you the full list of commands, but the two that you probably most care about are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">m dist</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">m docbi</span> The dist command builds both skulpt.js and builtin.js &nbsp;docbi builds builtin.js and puts a new copy of it in the doc/static directory.<br />Lets begin with a quick tour of the source tree:<br /><ul><li><strong>src</strong> - contains the implementation of the Python interpreter</li><li><strong>src/lib</strong> - has the module implementations of webgl and goog. &nbsp;This is where turtle will live and any other modules I implement along the way.</li><li><strong>doc</strong> - This directory contains a google app engine application and is what you see on <a href="http://skulpt.org/">skulpt.org</a> There are a couple of important files to check out in here. &nbsp;One of them is doc/static/env/editor.js &nbsp;This is the code that ties together the interactive editor on the home page with the skulpt interpreter and the <a href="http://codemirror.net/">codemirror</a> editor. &nbsp;If you know how to build a google app engine app then this directory makes sense. &nbsp;One thing about the home page is that it is not set up to use any of the modules. &nbsp;The modules are used in the more advanced ide, which you can find in doc/ide/static. &nbsp;I'm going to tell you how to add modules to the simpler editor later in this article.</li><li><strong>test</strong> - this directory contains a bunch of files for testing the implementation in a batch mode. &nbsp;These tests are run whenever you run m dist, or m test.</li><li><strong>dist</strong> - This directory gets created and populated when you run the m dist command. &nbsp;It contains the built and compressed versions of skulpt.js and builtin.js</li></ul>To illustrate how to make use of modules, here's an extended version of my earlier hello world style example.<br /><br /><pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;script src="skulpt.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script src="builtin.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/head&gt;<br /><br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />function outf(text) {<br />   var mypre = document.getElementById("output");<br />   mypre.innerHTML = mypre.innerHTML + text;<br />}<br /><br />function builtinRead(x)<br />{<br />    if (Sk.builtinFiles === undefined || Sk.builtinFiles["files"][x] === undefined)<br />        throw "File not found: '" + x + "'";<br />    return Sk.builtinFiles["files"][x];<br />}<br /><br />function runit() {<br />   var prog = document.getElementById("yourcode").value;<br />   var mypre = document.getElementById("output");<br />   mypre.innerHTML = '';<br />   Sk.configure({output:outf,<br />           read: builtinRead<br />              });<br />   try {<br />      Sk.importMainWithBody("&lt;stdin&gt;",false,prog);<br />   } catch (e) {<br />      alert(e);<br />   }<br />}<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Try This&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;textarea edit_id="eta_5" id="yourcode"&gt;<br />print "Hello World"<br />&lt;/textarea&gt;<br />&lt;button onclick="runit()" type="button"&gt;Run&lt;/button&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /><br />&lt;pre id="output"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre><div></div><pre><br /></pre>There are some important differences between this version, and the version and the non-module version. &nbsp;First off, the call to Sk.configure contains another key value pair which sets up a specialized read function. &nbsp;This is the function that is responsible for returning your module out of the large array of files that are contained in the builtin.js file. &nbsp;You will see that all of the modules are contained in this one file, stored in a big JSON structure. &nbsp;The extra key value pair is:<br />read: builtinRead<br />The read function is just for loading modules and is called when you do an import statement of some kind. &nbsp;In this case the function accesses the variable builtinFiles which is created from the builtin.js file. &nbsp;The other difference, of course, is that you have to include builtin.js in your html file. &nbsp;Note that builtin.js must be included after skulpt.js<br />Now as far as the module itself goes, the easiest thing to do is to start your module in the src/lib directory. &nbsp;This way it will automatically get built and included in builtin.js. &nbsp;If you don't put it there then you are going to have to modify the m script, specifically the docbi function in the m script to include your module. &nbsp;Suppose that you want to have a module called bnm.test &nbsp;Here's what you have to do. &nbsp;First, you need to make a bnm directory under lib. &nbsp;In this directory you will need to have either __init__.py or __init__.js or bnm.js to stand in for the bnm module. &nbsp;There doesn't need to be anything in the file as long as it exists. &nbsp;This is just like CPython by the way. &nbsp;Then to make a test module you can either make a test directory and put all your javascript code in __init__.js or you can simply create a test.js file in the bnm directory. &nbsp;Lets look at the test module.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">var $builtinmodule = function(name)<br />{<br />    var mod = {};<br />    var myfact = function(n) {<br /> if(n &lt; 1) {<br />     return 1;<br /> } else {<br />     return n * myfact(n-1);<br /> }<br />    }<br />    mod.fact = new Sk.builtin.func(function(a) {<br /> return myfact(a);<br />    });</pre><pre><br />    mod.Stack = Sk.misceval.buildClass(mod, function($gbl, $loc) {<br /> $loc.__init__ = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self) {<br />     self.stack = [];<br /> });<br /> <br /> $loc.push = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self,x) {<br />     self.stack.push(x);<br /> });<br /> $loc.pop = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self) {<br />     return self.stack.pop();<br /> });<br />    },<br />    'Stack', []);<br /><br /><br />    return mod;<br />}</pre><br />All modules start out with the $var builtinmodule = statement.<br />This test module exposes a single method to the outside world, called fact, There are a couple of key functions for building up a module. &nbsp;The Sk.builtin.func &nbsp; call for adding functions to your module, and the&nbsp;Sk.misceval.buildClass method. &nbsp;This test module defines a simple factorial function called fact, and a class called stack. &nbsp;Here's a simple Python program that exercises the module:<br /><pre>import bnm.test</pre><pre>print 'starting'</pre><pre>print bnm.test.fact(10)</pre><pre>x = bnm.test.Stack()</pre><pre>x.push(1)</pre><pre>x.push(2)</pre><pre>print x.pop()</pre><pre>print 'done'</pre><br />Its not obvious, but the buildClass method takes four parameters: &nbsp;globals, func, name, bases<br />It seems that you always pass the mod object itself as the globals parameter, the func parameter is a function that represents the class object, the Name is the external name of the class, and bases presumably would be if the class is inheriting from another class.<br />The Sk.builtin.func method creates a function. &nbsp;For module creation we typically only have to worry about the one parameter, func, which is the javascript implementation of our Python function. &nbsp;The method can also take a globals object and two closure objects. &nbsp;Look at the comments in function.js if you want more explanation of how the builtin.func method works.<br />Well, I think this should be enough to get you going. &nbsp;Its worth repeating, if you made it this far, don't forget to call m docbi or m dist after you make changes in your module, its easy to get into the mode of thinking that the new javascript is automatically loaded. &nbsp;But builtin.js is not automatically rebuilt!<br />I'll consider this post a work in progress, please leave a comment if something is unclear or you would like something explained in more detail.<br /><div

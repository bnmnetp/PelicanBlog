Description: 


<p>I've decided that it will be best to keep my personal blog separate from the new Everyday Python blog project.  All of the infrastructure to make the posts interactive just work so much better when I have control of the server and everything else.  So  You can head over to <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/everyday">Everyday Python</a> and click on the Everyday Python link there, or if you want to subscribe to the RSS feed for that project you can use <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/everydaypython">this link</a>.

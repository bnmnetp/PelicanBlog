I am going to have to go to PyCon.  Not next year, as I'm going to be in Malta at the time, but hopefully in 2016.  I don't know how many people attend, but the number is big, and they have sold old every year for the past three years.

I just got done watching one of the Keynote presentations online from PyCon 2014 held in Montreal April 9-17.  I'm linking to it below, because it goes right to the heart of most of my academic work.  But, it was especially exciting at the 20:05 mark.  Where she highlights `interactivepython.org <http://interactivepython.org>`_ and the `Skulpt <http://skulpt.org>`_ projects!

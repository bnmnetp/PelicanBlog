<p>Here’s a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK21DEIR91CB333">little plug</a> for our book from our Colleague <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~guzdial/">Mark Guzdial</a> at Georgia Tech.  This was written last September right after the book was published but I didn’t find out about it until this morning.  Thanks Mark!</p><p>In addition, David and I have started a new blog to post corrections and updates to <em>Python Programming in Context</em>  <a href="http://pycontext.blogspot.com/">Over here</a> If you are already using the book please check it out.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7817340241579693279?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

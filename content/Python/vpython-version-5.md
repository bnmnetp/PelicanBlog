Description: 


The other day I discovered that the folks working on VPython have been very busy over the last couple of years.  I had given up on VPython because the Mac distribution was so difficult to use.  It required the X windows server and one point and lots of other extra junk at other times.  But now things are easy!  There is a great installer package and it just works.<br /><br />For those of you who have not heard of VPython before it is a 3D graphics module called visual built on top of Python and OpenGL.  You can do a lot of nice 3D graphics very simply with VPython.  Its great for education in math and physics and introductory computer science.<br /><br />So as an experiment I built a turtle graphics module on top of VPython.  I use turtle graphics a lot in teaching but the TKinter turtles all suffer from some event loop problems when you use them with IDLE.  VPython does not suffer from this problem plus gives you a lot of other cool benefits.  One of the benefits is that the window resizes automatically for you based on the units you use in your application.  Want to draw a picture at the atomic level of detail?  No problem, want to draw planets circling each other?  Again no problem.<br /><br />Here's a screen capture of a fractal tree created in 3-D using my new turtle.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SenOsybCWeI/AAAAAAAAADI/vUI7S1pADpQ/Picture%202.png?imgmax=800" alt="Picture 2.png" border="0" width="510" height="530" /></div><br /><br />Here's the VPython turtle code:<br /><br /><pre><br />def tree(t,trunkLength):<br />    if trunkLength < 5:<br />        return<br />    else:<br />        turnDz = random.randint(20,40)<br />        turnDx = random.randint(20,40)<br />        trunkShort = random.randint(10,20)<br />        t.width(trunkLength/10.0)<br />        if trunkLength < 25:<br />            t.color(color.green)<br />        else:<br />            t.color((174/255.0,145/255.0,0))<br />        t.forward(trunkLength)<br />        # right trunk<br />        t.right(turnDz,ZAXIS)<br />        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<br />        # left trunk<br />        t.left(2*turnDz,ZAXIS)<br />        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<br />        # front trunk<br />        t.right(turnDz,ZAXIS)<br />        t.right(turnDx,XAXIS)<br />        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<br />        # back trunk<br />        t.left(2*turnDx,XAXIS)<br />        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<br />        # restore<br />        t.right(turnDx,XAXIS)<br />        t.backward(trunkLength)<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />If you want to check out the turtle module and play with it, you are welcome to do so:  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bnmnetp/vturtle  Or send me mail.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2070433995579609364?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

Now that I'm back from my JTerm travels, I'm happy to let you know that the second edition of Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python is available. &nbsp;(www.fbeedle.com)  David and I have worked hard on this new edition for about a year now, and we are really excited about it.  We think it is a great step forward from the first edition, and I'm really looking forward to teaching out of it next year.<br /><br /><br />Here's whats new:<br /><br /><ul><li>All code is now written using Python 3.2</li><li>Chapter 1 now introduces Python sets, and exception processing.</li><li>Eliminated third party graphics package. &nbsp;All graphics are done using the built-in turtle module</li><li>Focus on algorithm analysis in a newly written chapter 2. &nbsp;In addition this chapter includes the analysis of Key Python data structures used throughout the book</li><li>New section on linked list implementation in Chapter 3</li><li>Moved Dynamic Programming to the end of chapter 4</li><li>Introduction of C style arrays and array management in Chapter 8</li><li>More focus on graphical recursive algorithms, including recursive tree drawing, and a recursive maze search program.</li><li>All source code for data structures has been organized into a single Python package to make it easy to incorporate into homework assignments.</li><li>Source for complete examples from each chapter are included so you do not need to piece together code from each listing</li><li>A new improved version of binary search trees in chapter 6.</li><li>New secion on balanced binary trees (AVL trees) added to chapter 6.</li></ul>The main site for resources for this book is at http://www.pythonworks.org  <br /><p>In the meantime, here's the cover for the second edition</p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TUNP2iMUwpI/AAAAAAAAAL0/xohu9bItiOo/PythonDScover.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="PythonDScover.jpg" title="PythonDScover.jpg" border="0" width="400" /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5068655818648164128?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

Dear Apple,<br /><br />You lost a sale today.  I know its just one less iPhone you are going to sell, and in the grand scheme of things does not amount to anything.  I suppose its not really your fault, and as a loyal Apple customer its much easier for me to blame AT&T than you.  Still, it makes me sad to have to tell you this.  I waited as long as I could for AT&T to expand their network in my direction. I've hung on every Verizon rumor for two years.  Finally after enduring a year of carrying my iPod touch in the same pocket as the mind numbingly horrible Motorola Crush I bought an HTC Desire yesterday.  Android!! I never thought I would see the day.<br /><br />Here's whats even worse, I like it!  It has some great apps Gmail, Calendar, and many apps that I already love on my iPod Touch and iPad:  Dropbox, Evernote, 1Password, Kindle, Facebook, Twitter, Weather, Stocks, and a 5, yes 5, megapixel camera!  I already love the gps, so the location aware apps work, I love the WiFi and the Bluetooth.<br /><br />I'm going to miss OmniFocus, but I carry around my Ipad almost everywhere I go so I don't think I'll miss it that much.<br /><br />So Apple, I'll remain a loyal customer, at least for now.  I'm going to continue to develop my app for the iPad, I still love my iMac and my MacBook Pro.  But if US Cellular comes out with a decent family data plan in the next month or so you may lose two more sales as the rest of my family follows me into the smartphone world.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7948861859540801287?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

:description: Our first month back in the big city


Its a misty late October morning, the farmers market isn't open yet, and the Liverpool Cardiff match is on the TV.  Below us the runners for the Halloween half are spread out on West River Road. We are a little sleepy as it was 11:30 by the time we got home from "Beautiful" the Carol King story playing at the Orpheum.  We love our city life!

We moved in on September 24 and the rain started on the 25th and continued for two and a half weeks.  But once the weather cleared up we have taken advantage of some clear fall days to discover our new neighborhood.  A bike trail across the road leads to the "Dinky Town Greenway" which gives us a clear path to walk to TCF stadium in under 30 minutes!  I swear we have waited that long to get out of the parking lot after a Loons game in the past!  Even better were these views taken on a sunset walk home.  We love our city life!

Everything in downtown is walkable, but within a few blocks we have Thai restaurants, great breweries/brew pubs, fine dining, the Guthrie theater, and so much more. There is even a giant stadium, should we ever renew our interest in the Vikings.  By bike its less than 10 minutes to the computer science building at the University of Minnesota.  With access to hundreds of miles of bike trails right out our back door, I can't wait for warmer weather.  I've biked over to Macalester for a lecture and I'm looking forward to attending talks and colloquia at the U of M.

Our 1500 square feet is perfect for our needs.  A den for me to use as my office and reading area, an awesome kitchen and a nice living room for sitting or watching TV.  In the morning the shared workout room is an awesome place to workout and watch the sun light up the IDS and Wells Fargo buildings.

Jane and I have been slowly reconnecting with friends, family, and former students from around the twin cities, and we look forward to continuing that trend after we get back from upcoming travels.  We already love the fact that we will be able to take our bags and make the short walk to the light rail to the airport.  No home maintenance worries while we are away.

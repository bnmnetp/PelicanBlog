When I moved this blog to Octopress in January, it was inspiring in many ways.  There were two things that slightly bugged me. 

* Octopress is entirely too ruby based.  Rake, and all of that made me feel bad, like I was cheating on Python.  Surely there must be a similar tool in the Python world I thought to myself.  
* Octopress uses markdown.  I really like my restructuredText, and its just a bit irritating to have to think about the differences when I want to do a blog post.

Well, this weekend I found a couple of new static blog site generators that **were** python based, and after playing around with Pelican, and `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_ I settled on the move to Nikola.  I really like the image galleries and slideshows that are built in, and I feel like I can jump in and start hacking if something develops that I really want to change.  Plus, having already hacked a bunch of restructuredText directives, I know I can extend my blogging tool to do all kinds of fun things.

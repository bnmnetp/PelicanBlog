:description: Preparing a new curriculum for a new field in the modern era

In just under a week, we will officially launch a new major, in Data Science, at Luther College.  I've spent a pretty good part of my summer preparing the first two classes of that major, and as I look back on it its been an interesting experience.

Data Science is a new field, and as such there are no "standard textbooks". finding a Data Science 101 text is impossible.  There are hundreds of books on Data Science, and all of take their own approach.  Many of them are much more oriented towards working professionals with years of statistics and/or programming in their background.  Others are oriented much more towards a specific field either statistics or computer science.  We are aiming towards a middle ground.  Territory that is not well charted.  We are aiming our data science program at undergraduate students at a Liberal Arts college.

In order to understand our program, I want to make our learning goals clear.

* Analytical Thinking: Students can think about, examine, and explain the relationships that may exist between and within sets of data.  These relationships may include such things as patterns, cause and effect, similarities and differences, and trends.

* Communication:  Students can communicate the results of their work using appropriate techniques to tell the most compelling story.  These include oral presentation, visualization, and the written word.

* Problem Solving: Students can apply appropriate strategies to find, conceptualize, and implement a step by step solution.  In addition, they can acquire and learn new tools and techniques in order to adapt to changes in technology and scale.

* Collaboration: Students can participate in shared responsibility and appreciation for understanding how problems can have an impact within and across disciplines.  They can work with others in a cooperative manner to produce meaningful results.


These goals are translated into the two courses I'm teaching this fall in the following ways.  First in our DS 120 Introduction to Data Science course:

* Introduce some of the key analysis techniques used in Data Science
* Develop the practical skill of working with Excel
* Learn to think about a data set and generate a list of questions for further analysis
* Practice the art of presenting your analysis and findings in writing, verbally, and graphically
* Read and Discuss case studies of other people's analysis
* Learn to consider the Ethical dilemmas practictioners of data science face

Data Science 120 will be a very breadth first class.  We'll look at techniques for summarizing and presenting data graphically mostly with excel and Tableau.  We'll look at some machine learning techniques that we can implement in excel.

Then in DS 320 Data Analysis and visualization

* To become a skeptical consumer of data, statistics, and visualizations
* Develop an understanding of what makes a good Visualization
* To practice making and presenting several different kinds of data visualizations
* To become a competent "data munger"
* To explore several of the tools commonly used in exploratory data analysis:

  * Jupyter Notebooks and friends such as Pandas, Bokeh, Altair and other
  * Tableau
  * R Studio

* To put into practice some "statistics for hackers" techniques for validating claims that people make about their data.

Data Science 320 will go into a lot more depth on the analysis and visualization side.  We have another class for the spring that will go in depth on applied machine learning.

So, how do you prepare to teach this stuff?  With no existing textbooks that map directly onto our curriculum it has been quite a summer!

First, I want to thank the many alumni that have taken the time to reach out to me to discuss data science.  Its great to see the excitement with which our alumni are embracing this new major.  I've had many great discussions with people about data science in practice.  And lots of interest in future internships for our new majors.  Many of the ideas I have about this fall come directly from these conversations.

Second, its all about the data! duh!

Third, how do I go about learning this stuff?

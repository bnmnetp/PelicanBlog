:description: My interview with Michael Kennedy on the Talk Python to me Podcast


This interview with Michael Kennedy was really fun to record, and a nice overview of some of the work I have been doing over the past few years.  The podcast is well worth subscribing and listening to as he talks to a lot of interesting people about good Python packages, and other interesting topics around the Python ecosystem.

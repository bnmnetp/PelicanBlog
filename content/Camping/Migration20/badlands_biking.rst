I have often wondered what it would feel like to be in a major bike race with fans lining both sides of the road cheering you on.  Today I got a little taste of that on the badlands loop. It wasn't people cheering for me, instead it was thousands of Prairie Dogs!  And to be fair instead of chasing me down the road like the mad fans at bike races the Prairie dogs mostly just ran away.  But they make the most amazing chirping sounds that made me think they were cheering for me anyway.

The 19 mile ride I did on the road from the campground to the Wall South Dakota turnoff was made possible because I have a pretty amazing wife who told me I should hop on my bike and she would catch up with me later with camper in tow.  Not only did she have to hook everything up and pull out but she also had to empty the tanks!  I guess that is true love.

When I left the campsite it was only about 36 degrees and about a mile into the ride I was wishing I had worn warmer gloves.  But as I settled into the ride my body warmed up and I didn't notice the colder temperatures at all.  Indeed it also warmed up to a nice 65 degrees pretty quickly.  It was a beautiful solitary ride, I don't think I had more than 5 cars pass me for most of the ride.

At one point I did run into a bunch of cars parked on the sides of the road and it turn out that everyone was looking at the bighorn sheep.  If I was a better photographer I'm sure I would have found a way to capture all of the harsh beauty of the badlands.

This last picture is from the turnout where Jane caught up with me.  It was called Yellow Mounds which seems to match up nicely with our first night staying in Blue Mounds.

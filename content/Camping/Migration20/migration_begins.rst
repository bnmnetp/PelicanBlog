:summary: Migrating West to California.  18 Days with our Camper and many stops at National Parks
:description: We are on day two of our Migration West to California.

This is one reason why we bought the camper in the first place.  Take our time heading West, be in control of our environment and enjoy visits to our National Parks.  We started our trip on Jane's birthday and our first stop was in one of the towns I grew up in, Luverne Minnesota.  We spent the night at Blue Mounds State Park.  We met my aunt Jessica and Uncle John for a beer at the Take 16 brewery in town. It was great to see the town again and even more so to catch up with my favorite aunt and uncle.

From Luverne we hopped on I90 and headed West to the Badlands of South Dakota.  We did three relatively short hikes - The Notch, the Door, and the Window.

The Notch hike was by far the best, the other two are just board walks to some scenic views.  The most challenging part of the notch was this little ladder section.  It was so crowded when we wanted to come down that we had to find an alternate route.

The campground here is a nothing to write home about.  The individual sites are just wide spots in the circle drive.  and you can't really position your camper the way you might like. Our front door opens right onto the road so we can't even roll out the awning.  But we are not here for the campground we are here for the scenery.

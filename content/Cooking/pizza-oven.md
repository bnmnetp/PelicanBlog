I love it when a good plan comes together. &nbsp;Last summer we decided to finally take the plunge and build a pizza oven at the lake. &nbsp;After looking at the options to site the oven, and thinking about a fireplace/oven combination, we finally decided to combine the pizza oven project with our desire to replace the aging and increasingly ugly outdoor bar area.<br />In late June I contacted a few different stone masons to start to get an idea of cost and availability. &nbsp;I was immediately impressed with David Marek&nbsp;<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/www.layersofstone.com">www.layersofstone.com</a> and his ideas on the project. &nbsp;I checked some references and decided that my initial impression was correct, that David would be a good guy to work with. &nbsp;Here's his original sketch of our project.<br /><br /><img alt="Brad Miller Plan" border="0" height="331" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Akb0ivIiOQI/TnixuYBvTlI/AAAAAAAAAYw/NFDsPjnfh68/Brad%252520Miller%252520Plan.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: left;" title="Brad Miller Plan.jpg" width="600" /><br /><br />David was able to start tearing out the old bar, and working on the replacement the last week of July. &nbsp;He just finished the project last week, in time for us to enjoy some Pizza with our friends this last weekend. &nbsp;The result was beyond my expectations. &nbsp;Here's a photo of the final outcome that you can compare with the plan:<br /><img alt="6162728834 2a3c8d4985" border="0" height="333" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rxZ0eI9DcHo/TnixvImNP2I/AAAAAAAAAY0/7drzQ7ZYWPU/6162728834_2a3c8d4985.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: left;" title="6162728834_2a3c8d4985.jpg" width="500" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For more shots of the project you can check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157627580626967/">Flickr Photo Set</a><br />Last saturday was the inaugural pizza baking. &nbsp;It took about two hours to get the oven fully up to temperature, but the wait was well worth it. &nbsp;We used this <a href="http://recipepad.appspot.com/showrecipe/aglyZWNpcGVwYWRyDgsSBlJlY2lwZRiRpA4M">crust recipe</a> and pre-baked the crusts on both sides for just a few seconds. &nbsp;The crusts came out very light and crunchy. &nbsp;I'm looking forward to trying out lots of different crust recipes, but this was definitely a winner.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2405740608151021074?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

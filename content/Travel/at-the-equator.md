Summary: The highlight of our day of touring in Quito was definitely our stop at the Equator.

It turns out that Ecuador is a great place to study the equator.  Itâ€™s not in the middle of a jungle, but runs close to Quito with lots of varying terrain.  They thought that they had the equator nailed, but then along came GPS and they found out there were off by about 200 meters.  Now at the new and improved site we got to explore some of the common, cool things you hear about our hemispheres.

Not much to report today.  We got up and rode the shuttle to the airport, we checked in, our flight was on time, we sat on the plane for 8 hours.  Now we are sitting in the O'hare terminal hoping that everything will continue to be on-time for today.

We told the kids this morning that they were essentially getting up at midnight back in Iowa.  So by the time we get hope tonight (hopefully by 7pm) they will have been up 19 hours.  Josh of course immediately volunteered to stay up until midnight just so he could say he had stayed up 24 hours.

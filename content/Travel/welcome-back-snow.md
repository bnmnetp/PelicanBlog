Summary: An overnight flight from Quito, very little sleep, 90 degree temperature drop, and ❄️ ❄️ ❄️

Well it was bound to happen, and as we like to say, it could have been worse.  Landed at MSP just before 9:00 this morning.  It was 1 degree Fahrenheit (-17 C) and the snow was just starting to Fall.

The Galapagos cruise was unlike any other we have been on. High on the active scale, high on the learning new things every day scale, and with the small ship very high on the meet interesting people scale.  As the hotel manager John Flynn told us, they are very well aware that this cruise is a bucket list trip for most passengers, and they really do their best to make it memorable.  And that was just one component of this trip!

* Amazon Rainforest
* Machu Picchu and Inca trail hike
* Cusco and the Sacred Valley
* The Galápagos Islands

Jane and I have had so many interesting experiences on this trip that it seems like we have been gone for months, not just the three weeks.

We left Quito early this morning (12:30AM) and arrived in Atlanta by 5:30.  Getting through customs and making the transfer to the domestic gates was a breeze thanks to our Global Entry passes.  But neither of us ended up sleeping on that flight and we just dozed a little on the flight to Minneapolis, so we were both beat by the time we got out of the Uber in downtown Minneapolis.

In an attempt to wake up a bit, I went down to use the elliptical in our workout room.  As the minutes ticked away I watched the Wells Fargo building and IDS Tower disappear into the increasingly heavy snowfall.  We are supposed to get more than four inches today, and you can see that even this afternoon it is still coming down pretty heavily.

As with all good trips, we learned a lot, came to appreciate new cultures, old histories, and new parts of the globe.  It’s great to get away and get a new perspective on the business of everyday life, and to evaluate one’s priorities.  But as the saying goes, there is no place like home.  We are happy to be back, and already looking forward to an exciting weekend of activities including a play at the Guthrie and a broadway series performance!

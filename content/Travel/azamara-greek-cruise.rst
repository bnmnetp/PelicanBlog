:description: A quick summary of our Azamara cruise

For future reference I like to record the itinerary and favorite stops from a cruise.  So here goes.

Azamara Journey  June 12 - 23, 2015

* Venice, Italy
* Dubrovnik, Croatia
* At sea
* Crete, Greece 
* Santorini  -- hike Fira to Oia
* Mykonos  -- morning trip to Delos
* Patmos
* Kusadasi (Ephesus) Turkey
* Lemnos (replaced Lesvos due to unrest)
* Istanbul, Turkey

Its hard to say what my favorite stop was on this trip.  I enjoyed seeing the old city of Dubrovnik and hiking around the walls.  I enjoyed our hike from Fira to Oia on Santorini (despite the fact that it was hot and I complained about the heat)  I enjoyed our scooter rental explorations on Patmos.  I enjoyed our tour, rug bargaining, and the evening concert in Ephesus, I enjoyed our cooking class in Istanbul. 

Minus the screwup on our suite, the Azamara experience was really nice and relaxing.  We enjoyed the fact that drinks were included, and so we didn't have pocketsful of paper for signing for anything and everything.   We enjoyed our freedom to dine in the specialty restaurants (Prime-C and Aqualina) whenever we wanted, and we had a great time at the best-of-the-best night with the other suite guests.   The formal table service was a show unto itself, with all of our butlers serving us in synchrony like the servants at Downton Abbey.

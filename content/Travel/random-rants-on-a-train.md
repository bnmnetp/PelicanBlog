Description: 


I am writing this on the train from London to Edinburgh where they have just announced the breakfast options.  I don't get the concept of "English breakfast."  I would like to meet the chef who came up with the idea of serving baked beans and eggs together!  My guess is that if I did meet him I would learn that he was also the inventor of the "Pudding Menu."  At every hotel the included breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, and baked beans. I don't like baked beans under the best of conditions, and certainly not first thing in the morning.  I guess it must be one of those things you need to grow up with in order to appreciate.  In the meantime I will just stick to having tea.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, now that I have addressed the breakfast issue I will praise the train system.  This is really a the way to travel.  We have four seats facing each other in coach, tons of legroom, a table in between us, great scenery, free wifi, and a very quiet ride.  No long hassles of getting to the station 90 minutes ahead of time, and no long security lines.  Just walk to the platform, get on your train, stow your luggage and take a seat.  As we reevaluate travel the US I really wonder what it would take to get this kind of convenience.  I, for one would travel this way whenever possible.<br /><br />I also want to say how much I love traveling with my iPad!  This thing is great.  It's small, light, the battery life is awesome, I have a bunch of books to read on it, a couple of movies to watch, the current season of Merlin, and games to entertain me when I am tired of all of the above. Other than if I really needed to write a program I can not imagine why I would ever need to travel with a laptop.  In fact I think this is really the start of something new.  I don't see myself needing a laptop.  My setup would be a nice big desktop machine for programming and writing in LaTeX, and my iPad for the times I am not at my desk.<br /><br />Finally, as long as I'm rambling on about products and travel I have to say that I love my ScotteVest. (www.scottevest.com).  Its a vest designed for travel, that includes zip pockets for just about everything.  I can carry camera lenses, glasses, iPod, phone, and all kinds of things.  I think it has 20 pockets in total, so there is a pocket for just about everything.  It keeps me warm at the temperatures we are traveling in at the moment, and with all the zippers and inner pockets I feel pretty secure.<br /><br />- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5627967196197647954?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

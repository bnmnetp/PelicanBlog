Description: 


According to National Park Service literature, the combination of the Navajo loop and the Queens Garden loop is called the best 3 mile hike in the world.  I'd say they must be right.  The first thing that is just totally amazing is when you first peer over the rim of Bryce Canyon and see the vast expanse of hoodoos and the brilliant red colors.<br /><br />After eating a lunch on the rim of the canyon at Inspiration Point we headed down the rim trail to Sunset Point where the Navajo loop begins.  It seems like every step you take gives you a new perspective and another amazing view.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh30OthFjGI/AAAAAAAAADs/CNdnri06Ej4/IMG_7597.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7597.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />In the middle top of this photo you can see Inspiration Point, our starting location for the day:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh31Zv2TcsI/AAAAAAAAAD0/vSAUGwuXq8k/IMG_7616.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7616.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />Here is another view of Inspiration point from the bottom of the canyon.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh32B5HSnEI/AAAAAAAAAD4/1at9K4i_pJM/IMG_7668.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7668.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />And here are Kaia and Josh:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh32xLtf2EI/AAAAAAAAAEA/oHbBniuzuX0/IMG_7657.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7657.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><br />Dinner tonight was at the Bryce Canyon Pines Restaurant and Diner.  A great family restaurant a few miles from our motel.<br />Incidentally our hotel is the Bryce Canyon Grand Hotel.  Its part of the Ruby's General Store empire here at the north entrance to Bryce Canyon national park.  The hotel just opened last week and is very nice.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7389100232081200456?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

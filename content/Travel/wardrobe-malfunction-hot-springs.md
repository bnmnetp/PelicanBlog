![Lake Louise](/images/lake_louise.jpeg)

Sitting in our campsite in Banff, my feet are up, I have a Gin & Tonic next to me, the campfire is started, the sun is still high in the sky, it's 18:00.  My iPhone tells me that I have taken 35,196 steps and gone 14.6 miles today!  I believe the G&T is well earned. We are thinking of ordering pizza from Temple Pizza at the Fairmont hotel on Lake Louise because NOBODY WANTS TO GET OUT OF THEIR CHAIR!!

The first thing to say, is that today is totally a gift!  The forecast was calling for rain but today was absolutely beautiful!  Sunny and nice all day long.  We had a perfect view of the mountains and everything else around Lake Louise today.

The day started out cool, with temps down to 35 overnight.  Its OK, as Willard has a furnace to keep us nice and comfortable.  But we all totally overdressed for the hike today, as I think it got well above the advertised high of 67 degrees.  We thought this was our warmup hike of only 10K round trip.  So Brian and I said we would ride our bikes up the road to Lake Louise.  According to our best information it was only supposed to be 200 meters of elevation over 4 kilometers of distance.  A slope of only 1/20. Someone Lied!  it was 4k of straight up hill, lets just say we were warmed up by the time we got to the lake!

We took the obligatory, but still totally beautiful,  pictures at the the Chateau and then we headed out for our hike to the Tea House in the Six Glaciers Plain.  Six is definitely and overstatement, and if anyone thinks that global warming is a "hoax" they are idiots.  If you think global warming is a hoax, I'm sorry if I've offended you, but science is not a matter of opinion. Science is based on observation and analysis and the evidence shows that the glaciers are MUCH SMALLER than they were 100 years ago.  Why would glaciers be smaller?  Higher average temperatures.

Anyway, the hike was still beautiful, and Brian even managed to see a chunk of glacier break off and fall off the cliff.  The rest of us heard it, but by then it was too late!

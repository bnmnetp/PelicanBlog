    This sign says a lot.  Nobody reads it!
    
I think that no blogging about India would be complete without some comment on the driving!  It is a great example of both the chaos and cooperation present in the culture of India.  It is utter chaos in that although there are line lines painted on the roads, very few drivers seem to care.  Where there is only one lane you might find two or even three vehicles side by side depending on the size of the vehicles.  Passing?  No problem you can pull part way out of the lane to pass, the vehicle in front of you will probably move over a bit to the left and the oncoming traffic will likely move a bit to the right so you can get around!  I don't know what the statistics on traffic accidents or fatalities are in India, but amazingly we didn't see any during our visit to either Mumbai or Kochin.  I tried to make a video out the front of the bus as we were driving down the road and staring into an oncoming truck.  But it didn't turn out so you'll just have to trust me on this one!

Our day in Kochin was mostly spent on a small bus studying the driving habits of the natives, but we did make two very interesting stops.  The first stop was to do a two hour ride on a large houseboat that took us through the canals and waterways of Kochin.  We got to see the countryside and the rice paddys.  It was really good to get out of the city!

    The rice paddy.  Our guide said that we were in the Holland of India because the land is below sea level in this area.

Our second interesting stop was at a small bridge where we could see the famous chinese fishing nets in action.  These nets have been in use for centuries and it was fascinating to see them catching and hauling in the fish.

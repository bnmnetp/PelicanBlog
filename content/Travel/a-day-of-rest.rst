Today the sun was out and it looked like it was going to be our first beautiful dry clear day.  A good day to hang around the apartment and do laundry.  Maybe today we actually had a chance to get everything to dry for us!

After doing laundry and reading, I finished *Three Cups of Tea* this morning, we headed in to Monteone for some lunch and hoping to find an internet point.   We arrived on an extremely slow day the weekly market was just closing down when we arrived but almost everything else in town was closed.  No internet point, not public library.  We had a small lunch at someplace fairly forgettable.

We had one of the nicest dinners of the trip tonight at Casa Masi just down the road from Il Lebbio.  We definitely are getting the hang of european dinners and we had a little something from every course.  For our antipasti we had some bruschetti for primi I had pici pasta with a beautiful meat sauce, and kaia and josh had pici with a sheep cheese and basil.  Definitely worth trying to find some pici pasta to use at home!  For the Secondi We had steak, Jane and I both had fillet with a porcini mushroom on top.  Actually the mushroom was the only disappointment as it was a bit mushy.  For dolci Kaia and I had an amazingly rich chocolate cake, and josh had a fruit pudding.  I also ordered a little Grappa as a digestif.  We could have and should have walked home after dinner to work off the calories!

Tonight Josh and I finally recorded our first victory in 500!  After days of bad cards we were finally victorious.

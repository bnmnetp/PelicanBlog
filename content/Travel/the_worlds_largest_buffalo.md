Description: when you travel by RV you have to stop.

This morning we left the Pratt's at 8:00, right on schedule.  I took my first shift in the cockpit.  This thing drives pretty nicely except when the wind gets gusty.  Then you feel like you are constantly overcorrecting one way or the other.  As we buzzed along I94 through North Dakota, we realized that we were not really in the spirit of things.  No large balls of twine, no giant ears of corn!  Of course, there's an app for that!  "Road Trippers" to the rescue!  In no time at all we learned that Jamestown had the worlds largest buffalo monument.  After a quick stop at Cenex to top off our tank (38 gallons for about half a tank),  we ended up on a really bad gravel road that brought us into the frontier village from the wrong direction.   Oh well, we got there.

Now we are headed towards Bizmark for lunch and maybe a glimpse of the worlds largest Holstein!  Wait, how much large bovine statuary can we see in one day?!  We shall see the Holstein is reportedly some 40 feet tall and 50 feet long.

1.  Malaga to Antequera:  Tonight we stayed at the Convento Magadaleno after a very difficult ride through the Sierra del Torcal.  24 miles in the heat and a lot of climbing.  We checked in to the convent, and then used the spa.  Dinner was outside in one of the small hill towns close to the convent.
2.  El-Chorro to Ronda   Through the Sierra de las Neives.  We had seen El-Chorro from the train on the way to Malaga and were excited to bike here.  It is beautiful.  The afternoon climb was a bit much.
3.  Ronda - out and back to Grazalema  -- Jane stayed in Ronda to explore while I went out for the day.  The ride to Grazalema was great, and the hill town was cool.
4.  Olive trees in Granada:  Tonight we moved to the Barcelo La Bobadilla.  A wonderful five star hotel, with great restaurants and a good spa.
5.  Lunch in Iznajar:  We skipped the crazy hard climb to start out the day, and coasted downhill instead.  However since all hill towns are at the top of hills we still had a climb to finish off our riding and get a well deserved lunch in this cool town.
6.  Resting in Malaga

Description: Three nights in an over-water Bure conclude our wonderful vacation.

With a view like that you would think I could write something really inspirational for this final post of our journey.  Four weeks of travel with some absolutely crazy sights and adventures have wrapped themselves up here at the Likuliku Lagoon Resort in Fiji.  To put it mildly the resort is amazing.  A maximum of 96 guests, all adults, with a staff to guest ratio of about 2:1, maybe even 1:1 during the week here.  All of them greet you with a smile and the Fijian greeting of "Bula!"

You have a few options for getting to the resort from Nadi:  A ferry that makes the rounds of the islands three times a day, a private water taxi, a seaplane, or even a helicopter.  But whenever and however you arrive you will be greeted on the island by a small band playing welcome music and many Bulas.  Your luggage is whisked away and you get a cold drink and a quick orientation session on everything the resort has to offer.  Kayaks, Standup Paddleboards, and sailboats are a few of the things you can do off the beach.  Every guest in the over-water Bures is issued a mask, fins and snorkel.  There is a ladder right off the deck so you can climb down and snorkel on the reef right outside your room!  The floor in the room has two windows so that you can sit on the couch and look through the floor at the water and the fish swimming below!  Or Jane.

By mid-afternoon, high tide, the water is practically bath tub temperature.  The variety of fish we have seen just  outside our Bure is astounding!  We saw: Unicornfish, Clownfish, Angelfish, Parrotfish, Tang, Moorish Idol, Butterflyfish, Blue Sea Star, a Blue-spotted  Ribbontail Ray, an Eagle Ray,  a big old Moray Eel and many more.  Many of these are also visible just standing on the deck and looking in the water!  But cooling off with a bit of snorkeling is even better.  At low tide you are not supposed to snorkel in front of your Bure as the water is shallow and the reef is protected.  But you can still see some pretty amazing sights from the deck and the walkway.  Check out the video of this huge school of sardines.   Watch as the bigger fish (a Trevaly) swims though and leaves empty space behind.  The Sardines are also a favorite snack for the Gar.  Every so often as you are sitting out on the deck a school like this will go crazy and start jumping out of the water for a few seconds.

I really don't think we have had better snorkeling anywhere in the world!  Plus the convenience of snorkeling off your own private deck just can't be beat.

Dinner time is really spectacular.  You are seated right along the water and at 7:00 you have a fantastic view of the sunset as you have your appetizer.  The menu is different every day and all the food is really good.  This morning I had an omelette stuffed with mud-crab meat!  For lunch we had grilled chicken with papaya salad and rice.  The chicken was so flavorful.    Our first night we had a feast of Indian and asian curries -- prawns, crab, lobster, chicken, and lamb!  Last night we had delicious steak.  For lunch yesterday I had fried rice with at least a dozen big prawns with a spicy breading.  I didn't expect to be eating gourmet food for every meal here.

There are other activities you can sign up for, such as taking a wave runner for a spin to some of the nearby islands.  You can go for a two hour picnic on a deserted island, you can take a tour of the island where they filmed Castaway.  Or you can just relax, which is really the purpose of our visit.  After going and going for three and a half weeks, these last few days are the vacation from the vacation!  Today's activities were as follows:

* Get up and have coffee on the deck with my iPad while watching the fish.  I'm trying to avoid Facebook because all of the articles and discussion about lying Donald is really depressing.  "Alternative Facts" for pete's sake stop!
* Walk to the restaurant for breakfast -- delicious
* come back and lounge around in the shade on the deck while reading a novel
* Walk to the restaurant for lunch
* Do some standup paddle boarding to work off the lunch
* Find a shady spot by the infinity pool
* Get in the infinity pool to cool off
* return to the room for high tide and snorkeling
* shower
* open a bottle of wine for happy hour and pre-sunset drinks
* Walk to the restaurant for dinner

I'm exhausted just listing all of these things!  ðŸ˜€

Tomorrow we will spend the day here at the resort, then take the 4:00 ferry back to the main island and catch a cab to the airport.  Our Fiji airlines flight leaves tomorrow night at 9:40pm and we arrive 13 hours later,  the same day (well before we leave) in LA.  In fact we leave Fiji at 9:40pm on January 25th and we will arrive in Minneapolis at 9:00pm on January 25th.  Teleportation anyone?

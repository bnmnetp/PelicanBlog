Summary: A wonderful hike on Santa Cruz Island to see the Land Iguanas.

The activity of the morning was a “long” walk around Dragon hill on Santa Cruz.  The main objective was to see the Land Iguanas.  These creatures have been restored to the island after they were endangered by feral dogs and goats that humans brought to the island.  Santa Cruz is one of the few islands that is actually inhabited.

At one point they moved many of the Land Iguanas to an alternative island without any human habitation for them to come back, while they started a program to eradicate all of the goats and feral dogs.  We actually saw a goat along the way, and the guides, who are also park rangers when they are on land, had to call it in so that the goat could be tracked down and captured.

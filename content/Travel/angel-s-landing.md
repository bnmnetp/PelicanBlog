Our first day of hiking in Zion National Park was great!  Here is our goal for the day:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh0_SUYqOWI/AAAAAAAAADY/xZAwhhwEFYw/IMG_7451.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7451.JPG" border="0" width="640" /></div><br /><br />From the bus stop known as "The Grotto" we hiked 2 miles and 1,800 feet up to the top of Angel's Landing.  The hike to the saddle point in the middle of the picture was a fairly easy hike on nice wide switchbacks.  The rest of the hike was more exciting.  The park service has helpfully installed chain handrails to help you climb over any rough spots or to help pull yourself up the steep bits.<br /><br />Here's a picture of the Miller's at the saddle point:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh1JNmyyiJI/AAAAAAAAADk/tsnLyJuUZy4/IMG_3676.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_3676.JPG" border="0"   /></div><br /><br />Here you can see an example of what the last part of Angel's landing hike looks like:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh3yGzDxq1I/AAAAAAAAADo/rcCRU6aeYEU/IMG_3659.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_3659.JPG" border="0" width="640" /></div><br /><br /><br />Here's a picture of Kaia and I at the top<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh1BnPIE8jI/AAAAAAAAADc/Q8-fhlfPDYs/IMG_7524.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7524.JPG" border="0" width="640"  /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5888776664201501109?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

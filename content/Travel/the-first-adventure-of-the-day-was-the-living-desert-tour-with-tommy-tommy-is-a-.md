<p>The first adventure of the day was the Living Desert tour with Tommy.  Tommy is a fabulous guide, we laughed our way through the tour as this guy is just one great one-liner after another.   We saw lots of interesting desert wildlife, all of which lives in the sand.  The photo is of Ann with a desert lizard clipped to her ear.  </p>
<p>Along the way we also found an Chameleon, a sidewinder, a horned adder, and lots of different beetles.  You just can't believe the beauty of the sand dunes.  These are the largest in the world with some of them over 1000 feet tall.</p>

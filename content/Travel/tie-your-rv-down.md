As we got in the car to head over to the hot tub at the KOA in St. Mary's Montana, I pointed to the rope tied to the rear view mirror of the RV and the picnic table.  I said it looks like we tied the RV to the picnic table to keep it from blowing away!  Ha, imagine a picnic table holding back a 32 foot Winnebago in a 25 mph wind!?  But 20 - 25 mph winds are what you get in St. Marys, just east of the continental divide.  We had a lot of wind all day yesterday and today as we drove from Banff to Glacier.  This area is known for its wind and highway 22 even had signs with warning lights for RVs and trucks for days when the wind is gusting and dangerous!  Thankfully it was not bad for us at the time we drove that stretch.

Now, we are in a KOA campground, a source of some discontent amongst the group.  however it has a hot tub, pool, and laundry facilities.  These are all good things after a week of traveling together.  Plus they also rent cars that you can take on the road to the sun.  This is good as our RV would never be allowed to attempt the journey.  The roads are indeed very narrow, and the rocks overhang on one side and would definitely tear off parts of the RV!

This morning we got up and were on our way by about 8:00 on the "road to the sun". The main problem was that the sun was not cooperating!  When we got to Logan's pass we could barely see in front of the car because we were right in the middle of the clouds.  But, we kept on going and in the end we were rewarded, not with sunshine, but with "lord of the rings" mystical beauty.  The above photo is from MacDonald's Lodge.  Although the national park is called glacier, it could more appropriately be called waterfall national park at this point!

After MacDonald's Lodge we took the Avalanche Lake hike!   Wow, was this pretty, even in the dripping rain the sites along the way and once we got to the lake were well worth the hike!

After the hike we headed back the other direction on the road to the sun and by this time the clouds had lifted enough for us to really enjoy the scenery!

Of course no trip to Glacier, in June, would be complete without photos of the giant snowdrifts-cum-glaciers that we humans plow out of the way for the tourists!

And finally, no trip to Glacier would be complete without a picture of Goose Island!

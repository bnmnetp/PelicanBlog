Description: post malta holiday time, starting with lake como
Type:  text

After cleaning up the flats and saying our goodbyes to all of the students Jane and I are now comfortably ensconced in Villa Monte right outside the small town of Varenna on Lake Como.  We will be here for a couple of days before driving to Venice and boarding the Azamara Journey for an eleven day cruise through the Greek Isles.

By design this part of the post-Malta holiday has been to read and relax, so thereâ€™s not a huge amount to write about.  But Lake Como is so beautiful that it is worth posting a few pictures from a short hike we did yesterday and some pics of the lake taken from the terrace of our apartment.

We are not in heavy sightseeing mode, just a few hours each day.  The rest of the time we are relaxing and eating and trying some Italian wine.  Thursday we are renting a boat and taking to the water on our own.  It makes me miss my Moomba very bad, but it will be great to get out on the water and view some of the huge villas on the lake from the water side.

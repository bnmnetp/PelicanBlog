<p>Wow,  We were just here and just on this very same boat ride.  I wrote about it here:  <a href="http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/hiking-in-iguazu-national-park.html">http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/hiking-in-iguazu-national-park.html</a>.  Now today I find out that two American tourists have died doing that same excursion.</p><p>Apparently the boat hit some rocks and flipped over.  With the power of the falls and that river its amazing that only two people died.  <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/travel/tourists-killed-as-raft-flips-under-iguazu-falls-20110322-1c4f9.html?from=smh_sb">http://www.smh.com.au/travel/tourists-killed-as-raft-flips-under-iguazu-falls-20110322-1c4f9.html?from=smh_sb</a> Its worth following the link to the article as it has an awesome picture of a rescue working being lowered from a helicopter that gives you a sense of the scale of these falls.</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3992925394284503538?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

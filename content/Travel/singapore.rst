What country would you be in if I told you the following facts?

* 90% of the people are home owners, 10% are renters and 0% are homeless
* There is no unemployment
* Possession of a firearm is a capital offense
* Possession of drugs is a capital offense
* You cannot buy alchohol (except in a bar) between the hours of 10pm and 7 am
* If you have a job lined up your are welcome
* If you are a refugee you are out of luck
* you will pay around 20% of your salary for social security and your employer will contribute another 17% but you don't pay any income tax
* If you want to buy an Audi plan on spending around a half million dollars
* You will not see any trash in the streets
* You can leave your bike unlocked or your purse on the table and nobody will steal it.

If you thought I was describing some "commie socialist dictatorship" you would be wrong.  If you said Singapore, you are correct.  I will admit that all of these facts come from our most excellent bike tour guide from Urban Adventures, so some of it could be "fake news" or just a simple embellishment by someone who is very proud of their country. I haven't fact checked any of it yet.  But for as much as we saw some pretty cool parts of Singapore today we heard a lot that really made us think.

If you pay with peanuts you will only get monkeys


As little as $30 / month for housing in the low end social housing. You have to be married and at least 21 years old in order to qualify for social housing if your job is paying less than 90,000 / year

We began our outing to Rome with a walkabout starting at our hotel.  The hotel, Smeraldo, was very conveniently located just two blocks from Piazza Fiori, and from there a quick walk to Piazza Navona and then the Pantheon.  The group shot above was taken in front of the Pantheon.  We continued our walk past the under construction Trevi fountain, and the Spanish steps where we enjoyed a night view of the newly refurbished fountain.

After a nice walk we had a group meal at `Hosteria Romana <http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1035927-Reviews-Hostaria_Romana-Rome_Lazio.html>`_, where we (Katie) left our mark.  I hope that in future years other Luther groups will return to this restaurant, and that the logo will still be there.  If you do visit make sure you check in the back room and let me know.

Description: a great day on the water around gozo and comino

Every day is a good day when you are on a boat, in the beautiful blue Mediterranean.  After a bit of a mixup on the bus this morning, we got to spend 4 amazing hours with Captain Franz on a boat trip from St. Paul’s bay to Gozo to Comino.  Complete with caves, and cliffs, and swimming.  Click on the thumbnail below to see the photo gallery for today.

The bus mixup is amusing now that I look at it a day later…  We had arranged for van to pick us up at 9:00 to bring us up to St. Paul’s bay.  But after waiting and waiting I finally connected with my contact, Rachelle, at the University who handles all our transportation scheduling for us.  It turned out the bus company had screwed up the schedule for the day.  The solution was to send a coach. The only other vehicle available and in the area. No, not one with horses, a giant bus.  Wait by the corner we were told.  Oooops  wrong corner.  More delay.  Imagine the 14 of us on a coach that could easily hold 60 people.    So we made it to St. Paul’s in Style and in the end were only about 35 minutes late. Thankfully Frans was a very patient captain, and it was no problem  to extend our time in the afternoon to make up for our lateness.

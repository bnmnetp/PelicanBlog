Description: 


After all of our hiking and rafting adventure we are ending the trip with 3 days of rest and relaxation in Sedona.  Our major activities here are a Pink Jeep tour, Golfing, and a massage for the women in the family.  Otherwise we are doing lots of pool time and have even played a hand or two of 500.  Sedona is known for its red rock and beautiful scenery, along with crystal shops and the Ye Olde UFO Shoppe.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq8nbha5xI/AAAAAAAAAFM/7G1088HYM5k/IMG_8141.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8141.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />We did the Broken Arrow tour with Pink Jeep, which was fun.  I think we would have appreciated it even more if we had not already done all the hiking through Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon.   Nevertheless it was a good excursion.  While we were out there the kids decided to do some rock climbing.  Don't let the pictures fool you this was dangerous stuff:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq9EcmQuZI/AAAAAAAAAFU/OQaWwLBIbPc/IMG_8147.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8147.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq9a6hsYfI/AAAAAAAAAFY/I2n5d7fJrVE/IMG_8151.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8151.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />This morning Josh and I played a round of golf at the Sedona Country Club which is part of the Hilton complex.  It was a very nice course and Josh and I both played well.  It was a great morning to go as there was nobody in front of us and we were able to play at our own pace and move around the course pretty quickly.<br /><br />Josh got a new shirt and hat out of the deal as the club had a dress code and Josh did not have any clean shirts that would get him on the tee.  I played so well that I had to buy a new shirt to commemorate the occasion.  It was 25% off for fathers day so happy fathers day to me.<br /><br />Jane and Kaia both had facials and hot stone massages.  I can't go into any more detail about that. :-)  But they were both glowing and relaxed when they got back.<br /><br />Tonight we are going to go out for some barbeque and then come back to the room and get packed for the final leg of our journey.  Its been a great trip!<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7644008187979668747?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

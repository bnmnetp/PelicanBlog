Description: 


Long day of traveling today.  Left Minneapolis at 9:05 this morning and just got into our room in Springdale UT at 11:00 Mountain time, or midnight back home.  Actually we checked in a while ago but went straight to the Bit and Spur to have some dinner since our last meal was at Schlotzky's in Phoenix.<br /><br />The GPS said it would be a 7 hour drive.  it turned out to be longer than that because we took a side trip to the Desert View overlook in the Grand Canyon.  Here is a view from the Desert View of the Colorado River.  We'll be rafting down that river and into the canyon in just a few days.  We will be able to see the watchtower from the river on our way into the canyon!<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sht35AvBjnI/AAAAAAAAADM/5LwsSq8GlS0/IMG_7394.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7394.JPG" border="0" width="800"  /></div><br /><br />It was still quite a drive from the Grand Canyon to Springdale UT.  Along the way we crossed the colorado river just south of where we will get on the raft.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sht5eQVTyRI/AAAAAAAAADQ/ltwH_N4xuKc/IMG_7426.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7426.jpg" border="0" height="600" /></div><br /><br />We drove through Zion National Park in the dark.  We are all looking forward to a great day of hiking in Zion tomorrow.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2640837464153234085?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

All of our students arrived safely by 11:00 last night.  We got them up early this morning for a bit of sightseeing and wandering around Valletta.  We all did The Malta Experience, which gave us an amazing overview of the history of this island dating back to 4000 BC.  It is really incredible, Malta has been ruled by: Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Swabian, Aragonese, The Knights of St. John, French, and British!  I'm sure I left out a few!  A lot of it has to do with the fact that Malta is right on the trade route from the eastern to the western Mediterranean and beyond.  I am really looking forward to our history class which starts this week.

In the meantime, we are enjoying the sunshine, and the Amazing views that are everywhere!

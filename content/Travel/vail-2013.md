<p>The Colorado resorts have a really cool new way of handling the ski passes, instead of clipping a tag on your jacket you now get a credit card with an RFID chip in it.  Talk about a ski pass that appeals to the Geek in me!  But whats even better is that every time you go on a lift, there is an RFID reader that grabs your ID and logs that lift ride.  So now at the end of the day you can go on to a website and see how many vertical feet you skiied that day.  Very cool.  Over our four days of skiing we did just over 95,000 vertical feet!  If we'd only known how close to 100k we would get we surely would have had a shorter lunch break on day one!</p>
<p>Since snow started late and has been a bit sparse since Christmas there was a lot of snow making going on.  The mounds of snow created by the snow machines remind you of a Dr. Seuss drawing:

<p>I'm pleased to say that my skiing has really improved thanks to my Solomon BBR 8.9 skis.  I've started to call them my magic skis because I can even do the moguls!  Here's a picture I took of craig at the top of one particularly narrow and moguly run.  Note that I got down first with enough time to turn around and snap some pictures.

<p>Here's another shot of Craig just before he jumped off the cliff.  Note once again who went first to take the picture:   :-)

<p>All in all it was a great four days of skiing with the guys.  Can't wait until next year. </p>

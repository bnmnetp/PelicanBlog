It was difficult to get out of bed this morning.  The rain was making rainy sounds on the roof and there was a chill in the air.  Windows were cracked open an it was only in the 40's outside.  Someone had to get up and start the coffee.  Also, it seemed like a great time to try the heater.  I'm not sure it had been used before as it had that new furnace smell to it as it warmed up our little home.  This got everyone out of bed and eating breakfast.  It is Father's day today.  I've had electronic wishes  from both Kaia and Josh.   

Even in the rain our departure was pretty easy.  Unplug, retract, and go.  It was rainy and windy as we left the campsite, the rain ended pretty quickly but the wind hounded us all the way past Calgary.  We had quite the experience of refueling at the Costco gas station!    We pulled off Highway 1 expecting an easy (and cheap) experience only to find the lines 6 cars deep.  Thankfully there was a nice guy directing traffic who got us over to the line for the end pump.  It could have been a real disaster trying to make the turn out of the station if we didn't have the extra room.  We are finding that we are limited to $150 worth of gas which seems to be about half a tank!!  We can go from 1/4 to 3/4 on a $150 charge.

Outside of Calgary we left the plains of Alberta and climbed into the beautiful Canadian Rockies!  We are really getting the hang of setting up camp.  Less than five minutes today.  We'll have to move our campsite by about 30 feet tomorrow as we are camped next to the site we have reserved for the next few days.  After a quick lunch in the RV we decided to take a bike ride to the Village for some ice and then hike along the Bow River.  As you can see the scenery is pretty nice!

Description: 


I can see the campus from my house, its about a 20 minute walk, all downhill for the first half of the trek, then slightly uphill the rest of the way to the Olin building. &nbsp;I've always thought that biking to work would be the way to go, but I hate getting home all sweaty and gross. &nbsp;The problem is the uphill trek. &nbsp;From the River to My House is about a 300 foot climb over the course of just under a mile, a 6% grade for those who care to know. &nbsp;But trust me, its steep. &nbsp;It takes a lot of work to get up to my house, even on my road bike.<br />But, awhile back I was reading about some of the new electric assist bikes, and I thought hey, I haven't bought a new bike in a long time. &nbsp;So, I started doing a bit more research and decided that one of the Trek Ride+ bikes would be great. &nbsp;I ended up with the Trek FX+. &nbsp;Sadly, my local bike shop can't sell the Ride+ bikes, so I had to go to La Crosse to find this one. &nbsp;The good news is that this is a good time of the year to get a new bike! &nbsp; 30% off was the sale today.<br /><img alt="Trek FX+" border="0" height="223" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-oz5YYOkYY18/TpDG6iClFzI/AAAAAAAAAag/ngLF-wLwNTA/2011-10-08_16-13-01_814.jpg?imgmax=800" title="2011-10-08_16-13-01_814.jpg" width="400" /><br />I took it for a ride around LaCross and up the only little hill I could find, &nbsp;the Cass Ave Bridge, not much of a hill, but I knew I was on to something when I felt like I was riding on the flats with the wind at my back, when I was actually going up a little hill. &nbsp;After riding it around downtown a little longer I went back to the shop, smitten. &nbsp;The only decision was which panniers to get so I can haul groceries and my stuff to school.<br />Jane hasn't ridden it yet, but I have the feeling I know what she'll want for Mothers day. &nbsp;This would be the perfect option for our cycling marriage. &nbsp;I could ride my road bike and she could ride the electric assist. &nbsp;I think I see some longer bike rides together in our future :-)<br />The other great thing is that no gas is required. &nbsp;Its all battery operated, and as I coast down the hill the battery is recharged. &nbsp;I'lll be able to easily cruise my way to school, and then on the way home I can engage the electric drive at the bottom of the hill, and get the assistance I need to climb up to my house. &nbsp;I won't arrive home sweaty, and I'll have the satisfaction of knowing that I got a few extra minutes of exercise, and didn't use any gas! &nbsp;The only downside is that I'll be only inches away from the Whippy Dip as I ride home, but as long as I can get by there I'll be fine.<br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7356015564165588778?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

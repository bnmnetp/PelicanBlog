As an author myself, its sad to see.  I know that the first time I saw a student reading my textbook book for free on Google it almost floored me.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I don't write textbooks to make a lot of money, so its not like google is depriving me of a huge income, but there is that kick-in-the-gut feeling that someone has completely devalued your creation when you see it out there for free.  Its like, come on, I worked hard on this book for two years, putting all of my best thinking and ideas into it and you can't even bring  yourself to pay the $45 for it?</div><div><br /></div><div>So, if you need a book on Javascript or jQuery, do yourself a favor and buy this guys books.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-433157051186815373?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
